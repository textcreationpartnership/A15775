            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>TO <hi>The right Honorable my very good Lord</hi> the Earle of Southampton.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome ſeaven yeares ago (right Honorable) I was requeſted by divers worthy Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to write briefly ſome pithie diſcourſe about the paſſions of the minde: becauſe (as they ſayd) they were things ever in vſe, and ſeldome without abuſe: they were dayly, yea and almoſt hourely felt no leſſe craftie, then dangerous, much talkt of, and as yet never well taught. Their demaund ſeemed to me ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, honeſt, profitable, and delightfull, as I deemed it diſcourteſie, and incivilitie, not to condeſcend to ſatisfie their ſute. A treatiſe hereupon I penned, but I know not how in the inundation of my croſſes it ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack with the reſt of my writings: and at what time I ſuppoſed it had bin lying rotting in the bottome of the ſea, a favorable gale brought it aſhoare, where being found (belike by ſome that liked it well) was taken vp, entertayned, and diſperſed abroad. When I beheld it, I wondred, and could not tell whether to reioyce to ſee mine aborted infant revived, or feare whether it had bin maymed and corrupted: for I doubted it had paſſed by ſome hands, which might have cavſed me ſpeake in a language I never vnderſtood. At laſt I fell a peruſing of
<pb facs="tcp:21840:3"/> it, and in deede found, it had not bin hardly vſed, but kindly dealt withall, &amp; what eſcapes were overſlipped, proceeded rather from the vncorrected copie (for of three this was moſt vnperſit) then from any vncivill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynement. After that the whole impreſſion was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, the Printer made meanes to have me adde what I thought wanting, and to amend that I iudged amiſſe. And ſo I have augmented this edition with as much more as the firſt copie conteyned. The which after I had abſolved, it ſeemed of it ſelfe by a connaturall ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie to preſent it ſelfe vnto your Honour. For literall labours are vſually offered to ſuch perſonages, with whom they particularly conſort: and how could any paſſions finde out a perſon more proportionate then your Honour? They concerne Gentlemen and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to guide them in the way of civill converſation: Your Gentrie is well knowne: they appertayne to ſouldiours to ſtirre them vp to courage, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: your martiall proweſſe are patent at home, and famous abroad. They belong to Magiſtrates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for diſcovery and manage of ſubiects: your place, and evident hopes of further preſerment preſage, that this part cannot but agree to you. For me thinks as often as I conſider your preſence about his Maieſtie, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, with mine eyes to behold an other match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Parmenio,</hi> for truſt and fidelitie about our invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Alexander</hi> of the North. Wherefore my paſſions being provided for Courts, Fields, and Senates, finde in you vnited, that they ſought for diſperſed: for as it is di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>icill to determine which of them hath chiefeſt part in you, ſo it is eaſie for me to reſolve how fit this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is for you, which levelleth at all three. I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:21840:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> not but I might ſay to you as <hi>Plotinus</hi> a famous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher in <hi>Rome</hi> ſayd to <hi>Origen,</hi> when he entred into his Schoole to heare him reade, who preſently at <hi>Origens</hi> aſpect <hi>rubore ſuffuſus,</hi> bluſhing, ceaſed to ſpeake: <hi>Origen</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Porphyr. in vita Plot.</note> requeſted him to proceede, <hi>Plotinus</hi> replied, that it was time for a profeſſour to hold his peace, when his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors before-hand knew what he intended to teach. You need not learne of me thoſe things, which both by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and practiſe you have attayned vnto: yet it is no ſmall comfort for a man to ſee, either that he knoweth, confirmed, or that he doeth, approved. If theſe ſillie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhall content your Honour, I wiſh no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: for that which liketh you in this kinde, I know will not diſlike the beſt: and that which pleaſeth the beſt, by right reaſon, ſhould be a good inducement, to content all. If theſe blaſted leaves be acceptable to your Lordſhip, when the fruites are ripe, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a fatter crop: in the meane time Chriſt Ieſus preſerve you in his grace, protect you from your enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you from inordinate Paſſions.</p>

In what Countrie ever appeared ſuch a mirrour of learning, of ſubtilitie, of brevitie, of perspicuitie, (in deepeſt matters, and vnto worthy ſpirites) as when <hi>Scotus</hi> ſhewed himſelfe in the chayre at Oxford? whom, for his worth, ſome other Countries with no leſſe vntrueth, than ambition, have challenged for theirs, and would have bereaved England of one of the worthies of the world, What might I not ſay of <hi>O cams,</hi> of <hi>Bacons,</hi> of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> in forraine Nations more accounted of, than prized at home,
<pb facs="tcp:21840:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> whoſe doctrine, the beſt highly esteeme, whoſe wittes the wiſest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and whoſe opinions innumerable Doctors doe follow? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well glory in this, that our Countrie hath affoorded moſt of the maſters, &amp; of the chiefeſt Wits, which at this time both Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Reals, and Nominals do follow, eyther in Philoſophie, or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. And yet for all this, our Nation is accounted ſimple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, among divers others.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, let vs cast our eyes vpon all ſortes of Artes and Trades, from the very ſhooe vnto the hatte, from the ſhirte to the cloake, from the kitchin to the Court, and we ſhall ſee our Nation as well furniſhed, as compleate, and artificiall as any other: and as all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers can well affirme, farre ſuperior to the Spantards, and nothing inferior vnto the Italians. I muſt confeſſe, that in ſome one or other trade, the Italians ſurpaſſe vs, but they be ſuch, as eyther England regardeth not at all, or prizeth not very much: but, in ſuch as our Countrie esteemeth, wee may, eyther equall or preferre our ſelves before them. And yet for all this, a hie-minded companion doubted not, within theſe few yeeres, to call our Nation, vncivill, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others, to repute vs as ſimple and vnwarie. After ſome conſideration and reflexion vpon our ſelves, with reference vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, I found out three cauſes, why thoſe which inhabit theſe Northerne Climates, are accounted ſimple and vnwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The first is, a naturall inclination to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue and honestie, much more palpable and eaſie to be perceyved in theſe colder Countries, than in thoſe hotter Climates: this we may proove by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for both Spamards and Italians, if they can have a I lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or an Engliſhman for their ſervant, if he be alike qualified with thoſe Country-men, they will preferre him before their owne, for fidelitie, ſinceritie and diligence. The very bluſhing alſo of our people, ſheweth a better ground, wherevpon Vertue may build, than certaine brazen faces, who never change themſelves, although they committe, yea, and be deprehended in enormious crimes; for the ſhame of vice, is a good commencement of Vertue, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a iudgement diſliking of evill, which is an apt beginning of good. Wherefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth ſhamefaſtneſſe a vertue, not<note place="margin">Ariſt. 3. mora. Nico. cap. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> for that it is a true vertue indeed, (for it moſt of all raigneth in
<pb facs="tcp:21840:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> children, who are not capable ſubiects of morall Vertues) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſeede of Vertue, or a ſpurre to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue, or a bridle from vice: or a way, preparation or diſpoſition vnto an honest vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid that iuſtice &amp; ſhame faſtnes were<note place="margin">Plato in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagor.</note> the giftes of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> This naturall foundation of honestie, other Nations baptize with the Name of Simplicitie, which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not in ſuch ſort as it reſembleth a Vertue, and bordereth vpon ſinceritie and vpright dealing, but rather as a vice bending to ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, &amp; lacke of knowledge. The common ſort of Spaniards and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians, cenſuring our inclinations, with an erroneous iudgement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that a paſſion of ignorance, which in very deed, is the firſt ſtep vnto prudence, eſteeming them fooliſhly vnwary, whom they ought to have reputed rather vertuouſly wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is, Education, for prudence and policie are wonne by experience, experience by practiſe, practiſe by converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, converſation by communication with people, the which in Citties is better attained vnto then in Villages, and in Citties of greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and reſort, than in Cities of leſſer repayre. This wee trie by common conſent of all men, who acknowledge the inhabitants of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>townes to be more craftie than the rurall colonies, and therefore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers are iudged moſt craftie of all, yet my meaning is alwayes, <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> becauſe, as ſome Ilanders have little trade, ſo ſome Citties no great reſort. The nature of mens wittes is ſuch, that one whetteth and polliſheth greatly another, for as their faces are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo their inventions ſetches, ſleights and iudgements are diverſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thoſe that have great commerce with men, either they themſelves; or elſe ſee the various dealings and practiſes of others, cannot but in time greatly perfite their owne iudgements and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: this we may dayly perceyve in our owne Countrie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Northerne and Welchmen, when they come to London, are very ſimple, and vnwarie, but afterwards, by converſing a while, and by the experience of other mens behaviours, they become won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſe and iudicious. The Italians therefore and Spaniards, diſdayning greatly to dwell long in the Countrey, and betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves almoſt wholly vnto Cities, by a continuall converſation, even from their youth, become very nimble in the managing all affaires,
<pb facs="tcp:21840:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> and conſequently, very politique and craeftie. For great Citties (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Emporiall) affoord vnto them all ſorts of poſitique prudenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The moſt of our Engliſhmen contrariwiſe, eyther dwell in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, or in Citties not ſo populous, wherein they may enioy ſuch meanes, as enable other Nations vnto the attainement of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and prudence, wherefore this defect of converſation impeacheth greatly the warines of our Countriemen with other Nations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſundry of our rurall Gentlemen, are aſwell acquainted with the civill dealing, converſing, and practiſe of Citties, as many Kockneis, with the manuring of lands, and affayres of the countrey. Our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh youth alſo, for most part, are brought vp, with too much feare and terrour: for eyther their Parents or Schoole-maſters paſſe the borders of mediocritie in this part: becauſe they eyther puniſh them too extreamely, or threaten them too ſeverely: whereby th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of puſillanimitie &amp; feare ſpecially when any matter of moment is to be attempted, ſo distract their preſent attention, that they cannot almost poſſibly vpon a ſudden conſider the circumſtances, weigh the matter, and reſolve aright: for theſe reſtraining Paſſions witharaw a great part of their ſoules conſideration. The Italians and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards contrariwiſe, by bringing vp their children with more libertie, enlarge their hearts with boldneſſe and audacitie, in ſuch ſort, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually you ſhall ſee them at ſixteene or ſeventeene yeeres of age, as bold and audacious as ours at thirtie: and contrariwiſe ours at ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or ſeventeene, drooping with feare and timiditie, as if they were ſo many chickens drawne out of a Well.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe is, a certaine naturall complexion and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, the which in very deed inclineth and bendeth them of hotter Countries more vnto craftineſſe and warineſſe, than them of colder Climates; This we may perceyve in Italy it ſelfe, where the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mbards are more ſimple than the Romanes, and theſe not ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as the Neapolitanes, not theſe comparable to the Sicilians. The like we finde in Spaine, where the Biskains are not ſo ſubtle as the
<pb facs="tcp:21840:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> Castilians, nor theſe ſo craftie as the Andaluſians. Wherefore, as we proove in beaſts, that ſome, by their naturall inſtinct, are more wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e than others, as Foxes, Monckies, and Apes, ſo we finde in men, that ſome ſurpaſſe others in aptnes to deceyve, and in craftineſſe to circumvent. And in this we may confeſſe that Spaniards and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians goe before vs, for commonly they can better conceale their owne Paſſions, and diſcover others, than we. Our people, for most part, reveale and diſcloſe themſelves very familiarly and eaſily; the Spaniard and Italian demurreth much, and ſelleth his ſecrets and his friendſhip by drammes, you ſhall converſe very long with him, before you ſhall know what is in him: he will ſhew a countenance of friendſhip, although he intendeth revenge: he can trayne his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes afarre off, to vndermine where hee pleaſeth: hee will praiſe where he ſpiteth, and diſprayſe where he loveth for a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: hee can obſerve his times better than we for his plots, and marke fitter occaſions to effectuate his i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tent: he can winne ground in a mans affection by ſome ſmall converſation, and after prevaile in what he liſt, when he hath got the advantage. In ſine, he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble better his owne paſſions, and vſe himſelfe therein more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, than we can doe. Wherefore I thought good to trie if a little direction would helpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur Countriemen to counterpoiſe their native warineſſe, and open the way, not to become craftie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, which is vitious, but how to diſcover other mens paſſions, and how to behave our ſelves when ſuch affections extraordinarily poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe vs, the which is the chiefeſt poynt of prudence, and fittest mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to attayne vnto religious, civil, &amp; gentlemanlike converſation, which is vertuous. Whereunto especially this diſcourſe of Affections ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, albeit for more compleate doctrine, I have handled almoſt all thoſe questions, which concerne the Paſſions in generall.</p>
                  <p>But for all this, I would not have any man to thinke that I am of opinion, that all Italians and Spaniards go beyond all Engliſhmen in ſubtiltie and warineſſe, for I have found divers of our Nation, whom I beleeve, neyther Italian, nor Spanyard c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>God, the author of nature, &amp; imparter of all goodnes hath printed in euery creature, according to his divine

So we ſee fire continually aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpward, becauſe the coldeneſſe of the water, earth, and ayre much impeacheth the vertue of his heate: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie ſubſtances deſcend to their centre for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the hare flieth from the houndes: the partridge hideth her ſelfe from the tallent of the hawke; and in fine, God hath enabled every thing to eſchew his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and enioy his friend. Whereuppon grew that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite diſtinction of a triple appetite, naturall, ſenſitive, and reaſonable: the firſt we finde in elements and plants, the ſecond in beaſts and men; the third in men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles: the firſt, Philoſophers call, a naturall inclination: the ſecond, a ſenſitive appetite: the third, a reaſonable or voluntary affection: nevertheleſſe the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of inanimate creatures, and the ſenſitive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of living thinges, diſſent in ſome points; becauſe they with one motion eſchew their contraries, procure their owne good, and obtaine that they need; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the fire by the ſame motion aſcendeth to heaven, getteth his place, and flieth from earth and water, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: the boyling water ſet from the fire, cooleth it ſelfe, and withall, expelleth the vnnaturall heate. Men and beaſtes with one appetite proſecute the good they deſire, and with an other they ſlie the evill they abhorre: as for example, with one appetite a man deſires good wine, and with another deteſteth ill wine. An other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (beſides) there is, becauſe men and beaſts, in their appetites, have a certaine pleaſure and delectation, paine or griefe, the which affections can not be found
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21840:14"/> in any inanimate creatures. This delight or payne God imparted vnto vs, that wee might thereby be ſtirred vp to attempt thoſe actions which were neceſſary for vs, or flie thoſe inconveniences or harmes which might annoy vs: for who would attend to eating or drincking, to the act of generation, if Nature had not ioyned thereunto ſome delectation? A pregnant proofe of this may be ſeene in ſicke men, who having loſt their appetites, loathe nothing ſo much as meate.</p>
                     <p>Heere we may beginne, to diſcover the coaſts of Selfe-love, for God having ſo bountifully granted vs meanes to provide for ſuch thinges as were needefull, and to avoyde ſuch things as were harmefull, adioyning pleaſure to the one, and paine to the other: wherevppon enſued, that having a reaſonable ſoule, the which, like an Empreſſe was to governe the body, direct the ſenſes, guide the paſſions as ſubiects and vaſſalles, by the ſquare of prudence, and rule of reaſon, the inferior partes were bound to yeeld homage, and obey.

                     <p>Hereby wee may conclude, that Paſſions well vſed, may conſiſt with wiſedome againſt the Stoickes; and if they be moderated, to bee very ſerviceable to vertue; if

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:21840:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> there are, as more common, ſo more probable, and more conforme to reaſon. The firſt may bee declared after this manner: Wee ſee by experience, that beaſtes ſometimes have great facilitie to proſecute, or obtayne thoſe obiects they covet; as for example, a horſe, the graſſe which groweth in the paſture where he feedeth, ſometimes they have great difficulty; as for the Lyon to eate a Beare: ſometimes they have great facility to eſchew that evill they hate; as a Woolfe or a Foxe to eſcape with his prey from a little Curre: other times we prove they have extreame difficultie to avoyde it; as a Bull to fly from a Lyon. Nowe the authors of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication conclude, that the coveting appetite, inclineth onely to the obtayning of thoſe obiects which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be come by, and to the eſchewing of thoſe that may eaſily be eſcaped: the invading appetite onely inclineth to the poſſeſſing of thoſe obiects which may hardly be gotten, and hardly eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>This explication (in my opinion) as it is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſo it is more vnture: for who doubteth but many both love and deſire (which according to all Doctours are operations of the coveting appetite) divers things harde to be compaſſed; as, the two vnchaſte Iudges, the chaſte <hi>Suſanna:</hi> and in beaſts we ſee they often affect, love, and deſire, that they hardly can purchaſe. It were folly, to thinke the foxe affected, loved, or deſired not a gooſe, becauſe ſhe were ſurely penned vp, hardly to be come by: or the wolfe deſired not the ſheepe when ſhe is defended with the ſhepheards dogges.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, many be angry (which is a paſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading appetite) for things they may eaſily avoyde, as the Lady which child her maide, becauſe the floore of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21840:19"/> her chamber was defiled with a droppe of a candle. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we knowe God himſelfe to bee affected with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to whome nothing can be hard or difficile. Many things more might be ſaide concerning this matter; as how the difference, of hardly, or eaſily obtaining a thing can not cauſe ſuch diverſities of inclinations; for ſo wee might ſay our ſeeing might be divided; for ſome things we ſee with facilitie, others with difficulty; ſome ſounds wee heare eaſily, others hardely. Moreover, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of obtaining an obiect, rather deterreth a man from procuring it, than inciteth to proſecute it, and therefore conſequently it cannot be a cauſe of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But theſe arguments, and many more, for brevities ſake I omit, pretending after another maner to explicate this diviſion.</p>
                     <p>The other explication, and as eaſie to be perceived as the precedent, is this. Firſt, as we have inſinnuated before, God and Nature gave men and beaſts theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtincts or inclinations, to provide for themſelues all thoſe thinges that are profitable, and to avoyde all thoſe things which are damnifieable: and this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may bee called, <hi>concupiſcibilis,</hi> coveting; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that GOD did foreſee, that oftentimes there ſhould occurre impediments to hinder them from the execution of ſuch inclinations, therefore he gaue them an other inclination, to helpe themſelues to overcome or avoide thoſe impediments, and to invade or impugne whatſoever reſiſteth: for the better execution whereof, he hath armed all beaſts, either with force, craft, or ſlight, to eſchew all obſtacles that may detayne them from thoſe things which they conceive as convenient. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Bull hee hath imparted hornes, to the Boare
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21840:20"/> his tuskes, to the Lion clawes, to the Hare her heeles, to the Fox craft, to Men theyr hands and witte: And for this cauſe wee ſee the very little children, when any woulde deprive them of theyr victualles, for lacke of ſtrength to fight, they arme themſelves with teares. To this explication it ſeemeth that the names of <hi>Iraſcibilis</hi> and <hi>Concupiſcibilis</hi> more aptly agree, than to the other, becauſe heere onely <hi>Iraſcibilis</hi> invadeth and impugneth, and not affecteth or deſireth, as in the other. And thus much concerning this diviſion. How many Paſſions there are coveting, and how many invading, in the next Chapter ſhalbe declared.</p>

The latter five are, hope, and deſpaire, feare, and audacitie, the fift is ire. This number may be declared by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and approoved with reaſon: the experience is common (welnie) in all beaſts, but moſt evident in the

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the thing deſired be preſent, and poſſeſſed, then riſeth vp the paſſion of Pleaſure and Delight: ſo that our affections are carryed to good thinges, eyther ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, future, or preſent; for good thinges paſſed, although they often ſtirre in a man, pleaſure, yet they are conceyved, after a ſorte, of preſence; either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were acceptfull to God then, and ſo pleaſe him yet; or for the preſent teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for the precedent vertuous actions; or finally, for the credite, honour, and glory, which remayneth with thoſe who were witneſſes of our good behaviour and godly proceedings.</p>

While he was in this deliberation, the Phyſitian brought him the potion. When the King ſawe him, he rayſed himſelfe vpon his elbow, and taking his letter in his left hand, with the other hand hee tooke the cuppe, and ſtrait ſupped it off: when he had done ſo, hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the letter to <hi>Philip</hi> to reade, and whileſt hee was reading, he beheld him continually in the face, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that if hee had bin faulty, ſome token would have appeared in his countenance: when <hi>Philip</hi> had read the letter, he ſhewed more tokens of diſpleaſantneſſe, than

Beſides, whence-from proceedeth laughter, dauncing, ſinging, and many ſuch externall ſinges of ioy, but (as wee ſay) from a merrie heart? therefore ioy and feare dwell in the heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I thinke this moſt true, and eſpecially in thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are about obiectes abſent, as love, hatred, hope, flight, ire, and ſuch like; yet I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that when the obiectes are preſent, and poſſeſſed by ſenſe, then the paſſions inhabite, not onely the heart, but alſo are ſtirred vp in every part of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as any ſenſitive operation is exerciſed; for if wee taſte delicate meates, ſmell muske, or heare muſicke, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve, notonely that the heart is affected, but that alſo the paſſion of ioy delighteth thoſe partes of our ſences: the like wee prove in payne and griefe, for which cauſe commonly wee ſay, our teeth ake, our fingers, toes, or legges payne vs: Payne therefore, and Pleaſure, beeing Paſſions of the Minde, and evermore felt in that part of the bodie, where Senſe exerciſeth her operations: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as touching is diſperſed thorow the whole bodie, even ſo the Paſſions of pleaſure and payne; for in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie parte, if it bee cheriſhed, it reioyceth, if be hurte, it payneth.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuppoſing the Paſſions principally reſide in the hearte, as wee perceyve by the concourſe of humours thereunto, wee may demaund two curious queſtions. The former is, for what ende hath Nature given this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21840:26"/> or flocking of humours to the hearte? It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, queſtionleſſe, for ſome good ende; for God and Nature worke not by chaunce, or without reſpecting ſome benefite of the ſubiect.</p>
                     <p>To the which queſtion it may bee anſwered; Firſt,<note place="margin">Why humors flocke to the heart in paſſions.</note> that the humours concurre to helpe, diſpoſe, and enable the heart to worke ſuch operations: for as we prove by experience, if a man ſleepe with open eyes, although his ſight be marvellous excellent, yet he ſeeth nothing, becauſe in ſleepe, the purer ſpirites are recalled into the inner partes of the body, leaving the eyes deſtitute of ſpirits, and abandoned of force, which preſently in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king returne againe: euen ſo I conceive, the heart, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by nature to digeſt the blood ſent from the liver, yet for divers reſpectes, not to have the temperature which all Paſſions require; for love will have heate, and ſadneſſe colde, feare conſtringeth, and pleaſure dilateth; the heart therefore which was to bee ſubiect to ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Paſſions, by Nature was deprived of all ſuch contrary diſpoſitions, as the Philoſophers ſay, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria prima caret omni forma, quia omnes formas recipere debet.</hi> And, although the hearte hath more exceſſe of heate than colde, yet a little melancholly blood may quickly change the temperature, and render it more apt for a melancholly Paſſion; The ſecond reaſon may be, for that theſe humours affecting the heart, cauſe payne or pleaſure, thereby inviting Nature, to proſecute the good that pleaſeth, and to flie the evill that annoyeth: as in the Common-wealth, Vertue ought to be rewarded with preferment, and vice to be corrected with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; even ſo in this little common-wealth of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, actions conformable to Nature, are repayde with
<pb facs="tcp:21840:27"/> pleaſure, and paſſions diſconſorting nature, puniſhed with payne.</p>
                     <p>The other queſtion concerneth the efficient cauſe of theſe humours, what cauſeth their motions to the heart; they themſelves, as it were, flie vnto the heart? or the parte where they ſoiourned, ſendeth or expelleth them from her, and ſo for common refuge they runne to the heart? or finally, the heart draweth them vnto it? This difficultye requireth an anſwere, whereby many ſuch like queſtions may bee reſolved: as for example, when the meate in our ſtomackes is ſufficiently diſgeſted, the chile which there remayneth, prepared to be ſent to the liver for a further concoction; doth it aſcend thither by it ſelfe, as vapours to the head? or doth the ſtomacke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it? or the liver drawe and ſucke it?</p>
                     <p>To this demaund I anſwere, that (in mine opinion) the partes from whence theſe humours come, vſe their expulſive vertue, ſending the ſpirites choler, or blood, to ſerve the heart in ſuch neceſſity, as the hand lifteth vp it ſelfe to defend the head: howbeit, I doubt not, but the heart alſo affected a little with the paſſion, draweth more humors, &amp; ſo encreaſeth. Many more curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections here I omit, which perhaps would delight the more ſubtil wits, but hardly of many to be conceived.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of the precedent Chapter we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how that the heart is the ſeate of our paſſions, that ſpirites and humours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with them: here we may deduce a concluſion moſt certayne and profitable, that according to the diſpoſition of the heart, humours, and body, divers ſortes of perſons be ſubiect to divers ſortes of paſſions, and the ſame paſſion affecteth divers perſons in divers manners: for, as we ſee fire applyed to drie wood, to yron, to flaxe, and gunpowder, worketh divers wayes; for in wood it kindleth with ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and with ſome difficulty is quenched; but in flaxe ſoone it kindleth, and quencheth; in yron with great difficulty is it kindled, and with as great extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; but in gunpowder it is kindled in a moment, and never can bee quenched till the powder be conſumed. Some men you ſhall ſee, not ſo ſoone angrie, nor yet ſoone pleaſed, and ſuch be commonly fleugmatike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; others you have, ſoone angrie, ſoone friended, as thoſe of a ſanguine complexion, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are called good fellowes: others be hardly offended, and afterward, with extreame difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as melancholy men: others are all fiery, and in a moment, at every trifle they are inflamed, and, till their heartes be conſumed (almoſt) with choller, they never ceaſe, except they be revenged.

And, as in mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the body, every wiſe man feeleth beſt his owne griefe; euen ſo, in the diſeaſes of the ſoule, every one knoweth beſt his owne inclination: nevertheleſſe, as Phyſitions commonly affirme, how there be certayne vniverſall cauſes which incline our bodies to divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; ſo there are certayne generall cauſes, which move our ſoules to ſundry paſſions. Firſt, young men generally are arrogant, prowde, prodigall, incontinent, given to all ſortes of pleaſure. Their pride proceedeth from lacke of experience; for they will vaunt of their ſtrength, beautie, and wittes, becauſe they have not yet tryed ſufficiently, how farre they reach, how frayle they are; therefore they make more account of them, than in very deede they ought to be eſteemed. Their prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality is cauſed by confidence they have in their owne ſtrength and abilitie, whereby they thinke they ſhall be able to get more; contrariwiſe, both olde men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are conſecrated to covetouſnes, becauſe the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their bodies promiſeth them no ſuch force, as they may be inabled to gather much more: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall finde, that old women, where both weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſexe, and feebleneſſe of body concurre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be moſt addicted to avarice.</p>
                     <p>Yoong mens incontinencie, boldeneſſe, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proceedeth of heat which aboundeth in them, and thoſe, whoſe complexions are hoteſt, are moſt ſubiect to theſe affections. They extreamely affect plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, becauſe they ſpent (as boyes) almoſt the time of growth in getting of habites, alluring and haling to pleaſure; for commonly wee ſee all ſortes of boyes, till
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21840:28"/> they come to the vſe of reaſon and diſcretion, moſt addicted to paſtimes and playes. Beſides, heate woulde be eaſily extinguiſhed in youth, if they did not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately exerciſe it in time of growth, for that the moyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their bodies, and ſuperfluous humors woulde otherwiſe hardly be conſumed: And I haue ſeene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers youthes too much brideled, and therefore broken: yet immoderat paſtimes inflameth their blood, and cauſeth agews, and death. Youth alſo are inconſtant, and rarely perſiſt long in one purpoſe, partely occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as I thinke) by many alterations of their bodies, which eaſily will chaunge their mindes; and partely helped with the lacke of a ripe reſolution, and firme iudgement, becauſe, as daily they varie in opinions, ſo daily they alter their determinations.</p>
                     <p>Olde men are ſubiect to ſadneſſe, cauſed by coldneſſe of bood: to ſuſpect ill, by reaſon of long experience, wherein they haue often beene deceived; to lament, to bee faſtidious, teaſtie, froward, and neuer conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that <hi>ipſa ſenectus morbus eſt,</hi> Olde age is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſickeneſſe: wherefore, as ſicke men are ever wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo olde men are never ſatisfied. They are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be obſtinate in their owne opinions, becauſe many of them condemne yoong men of lacke of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and practiſe, imagining that learning and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould harbour vnder a night-cappe. Herevpon groweth a certaine ſpirit of contempt, whereby they deſpiſe the yonger ſort: and as travellers, for the moſt part, relate mountaines of marvelles, that they haue ſeene and heard in forraine countries, ſo olde men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wonders they ſee and heard in paſſed ages.

                     </q>
                     <p>This Inconſtancie principally ſpringeth from the ſame roote, that the inſtabilitie of yoong men iſſueth from, that is, lacke of prudence and iudgement in their determinations; for wiſe men doe not reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues verie quickely, but with great conſideration and deliberation, and therefore they expend well the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and impediments, which may occurre and hinder that they reſolved to doe. But yoong men and women, for the moſt part, reſolve raſhly and performe rarely, becauſe that they concluded without maturity, and in the execution finde ſome impediments; for which of neceſſitie they muſt miſcary: from this ſame vnpure fountayne deſcendes that endleſſe talke daily frequented by women; for in halfe an houre five men will bee wearie with conference, and barren in matter, but three women will jangle, and never lacke new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to diſcourſe vpon.</p>
                     <p>Many things more might be ſayde of this matter, but I finde all bookes and common places, ſo ſtuffed with theſe diſcourſes, that I thought it ſuperfluous to write any more, eſpecially, for that I knowe, that women will be eaſily offended with thoſe that diſpraiſe them, as they will be woonderfully well pleaſed with thoſe that commend them: yet they muſt pardon me, if
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21840:30"/> with their good inclinations I ſhew the ill; if I ſay, commonly they be inclined to ſuch paſſions, yet euery rule admitteth ſome exception; yea, if they be ill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and refraine thoſe affections, queſtionleſſe, the greater is their commendation: for as the husbandman deſerveth more praiſe, if he manure well a thornie ſoile than a fertile fielde; ſo that women ought more to bee prized, which is worſt inclined, and beſt mortified.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to conclude, I am not of <hi>Senecaes</hi> opinion, that <hi>Mulier amat, aut odit, nihil eſt tertium,</hi> that a woman loveth, or hateth, and nothing is third; for although in ſome ſorte of women, I holde it very probable, yet I cannot allow it to be common to all; for, onely women that bee of a hote complexion, and for the moſt parte, thoſe that be blacke or browne, I take to be of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and indeede thoſe have their affections moſt vehement, and perhappes, little women have a ſmacke thereof, according to our Engliſh Proverbe:</p>

The heart immediatly bendeth, either to proſecute it, or to eſchewe it: and the better to effect that affection, draweth other humours to helpe him, and ſo in pleaſure concurre great ſtore of pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; in payne and ſadneſſe, much melancholy blood, in ire, blood and choller; and not onely (as I ſayde) the heart draweth, but alſo the ſame ſoule that informeth the heart reſiding in other partes, ſendeth the humours vnto the heart, to performe their ſervice in ſuch a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie place: In like maner as when we feele hunger (cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſucking of the liver and defect of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſtomacke) the ſame ſoule which informeth

To the authoritie of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, experience agreeth, for I never knewe any man troubled with a vehement paſſion of hatred, ire, or love, who would not bring many reaſons to confirme his purpoſe, although after he had performed his pleaſure, and the tempeſtuous paſſion was paſt, hee condemned himſelfe, and thought his fact vitious, and his reaſons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21840:33"/> frivolous. The which experience teacheth vs, that men (for the moſt parte) are not very good iudges in their owne cauſes, ſpecially for the Paſſion of Love, which blindeth their iudgement; for which, <hi>Nathan</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>David</hi> his owne fault, as another mans caſe; how the rich man, by force, bereaved the poore man of his ſheepe, having ſo many of his owne, becauſe he knew, that <hi>Davids</hi> iudgement, in his owne cauſe, might eaſily be corrupted: the ſelfeſame did the good woman <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuites</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> for the recalling of <hi>Abſolon:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Paſſions, not vnfittely may bee compared to greene ſpectacles, which make all thinges reſemble the colour of greene; even ſo, he that loveth, hateth, or by any other paſſion is vehemently poſſeſſed, iudgeth all things that occurre in favour of that paſſion, to be good and agreeable with reaſon, ſo there ſcarſe can be found any man that hateth, or is angry with an other, but hee thinketh his hatred and ire to be moſt iuſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for in very deede, while the Paſſion is afloate, the execution and performance thereof, is conformable and very convenient vnto our beaſtly ſenſuall appetite, and therefore all beaſtes ſtinged by ſuch paſſions, preſently proceede vnto execution, but men having vnited in the ſame ſenſitive ſoule, reaſon and diſcourſe, are bound, both by the lawe of Nature, and commaundement of God, divers times to repreſſe and reſiſt ſuch vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beaſtly motions. Yet I know ſome ſubtill witte would gladly vnderſtand how it commeth to paſſe, that vehement paſſions ſo vndermine the iudgement, and ſuborne it to give ſentence in favour of them: for, why may not the paſſion, beeing in the hearte, and inferior parte of the ſoule, permitte the higher portion, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21840:34"/> ſeate of Reaſon alone, without trouble or mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation; as we ſee by experience, that fire being drie and hotte by nature, although it heateth, yet that hindereth not the drying; ſo, why may not the witte iudge aright, howbeit the paſſion affecteth a wrong?</p>
                     <p>To this obiection three reaſons may be rendered. The firſt I have largely delivered in my third Booke of the Ioyes of heaven: and in ſumme, this is the ſubſtance. Our ſoule being of a determinate power and activitie, cannot attend exactly to twoo vehement and intenſive operations together: as for example, wee cannot attend perfectly to ſweete muſicke, perceive daintie ſmelles, or taſte delicate meate, all three, or twoo of them at one time, either for lacke of ſpirites, or in regarde of the limitted influence of the ſoule, which cannot impart ſufficient activitie to ſuch intenſive operations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule being poſſeſſed of a vehement paſſion, her force is ſo exhauſted in that action, that if ſhee will continue therein, ſhee can not exactly conſider the reaſons which may diſſwade her from attending or following ſuch affections: the paſſion therefore which hindereth and ſtopp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th the eyes of the vnderſtanding from the conſideration of thoſe meanes which might moove the mind to withdrawe it ſelfe from that action, may well bee ſaide to blinde the witte, as hee which ſhutteth another mans eyes, maketh him blindefolde, not by taking away the power of ſeeing, but onely by hindering it from action.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, not onely a privation of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoſe thinges, which may extinguiſh the paſſion, but alſo an inforcement or conſtraint, onely to conſider thoſe motives or reaſons which tend in favour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21840:34"/> of that paſſion: for although the mayne parte of the ſoules activitie bee haled away with the paſſion, yet there remaineth ſome ſparks of light in the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to perceive what is repreſented vnto it, as when we heare ſweete excellent muſicke, we may perceyve ſome dainety ſmelles, howebeit, not in that perfection wee might, if our ſoules were not diſtracted with hearing; even ſo, ſome life is left to be imployed to vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, albeit not ſo great, becauſe the ſoule is diſtracted with a Paſſion, the which inforceth the witte onely to conſider, what may conduce to the continuation and preſervation thereof: the manner may thus bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for whatſoever we vnderſtand, paſſeth by the gates of our imagination, the coſin germane to our ſenſitive appetite, the gates of our imagination being prevented, yea, and welnie ſhutte vp with the conſideration of that obiect which feedeth the paſſion, and pleaſeth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; the vnderſtanding looking into the imagination, findeth nothing almoſt but the mother and nurſe of his paſſion for conſideration, where you may well ſee how the imagination putteth greene ſpectacles before the eyes of our witte, to make it ſee nothing but greene, that is, ſerving for the conſideration of the Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the imagination repreſenteth to the vnderſtanding, not onely reaſons that may favour the paſſion, but alſo it ſheweth them very intenſively, with more ſhew and apparance than they are indeede; for as the Moone, when ſhe riſeth or ſetteth; ſeemeth greater vnto vs, than indeede ſhee is, (becauſe the vapours or clowdes are interpoſed betwixt our eyes and her) even ſo, the beauty and goodneſſe of the obiect repreſented to our vnderſtanding, appeareth fayrer and goodlier
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21840:35"/> than it is, becauſe a clowdy imagination interpoſeth a miſte. And here it falleth foorth, as hee which is moſt ſtudious, is beſt learned; and commonly, he that is beſt learned, is moſt ſtudious: ſo, hee that once apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the pleaſure of the paſſion, ordinarily followeth it, and the paſſion increaſeth the imagination thereof, and the ſtronger imagination rendreth the paſſion more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, ſo that oftentimes they enter but with an inch, and encreaſe an ell: whereupon enſueth, that a falſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination corrupteth the vnderſtanding, making it beleeve that thinges are better than they are in very deede. And by this meanes, the witte two wayes is troubled; firſt, in that the vehemency of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauſeth a vehement apprehenſion and iudgement of the witte; ſecondarily, the falſe repreſentation bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a falſe conceite in the minde: and by theſe wee prove the imagination and paſſions to prevaile ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that men, in great payne, or exceeding pleaſure, can ſcarce ſpeake, ſee, heare, or thinke of any thing, which concerneth not their paſſion.</p>
                     <p>And for this ſame cauſe, when wiſe men deale with any perſon wonderfully penſive, commonly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour with reaſons to diminiſh the cauſe of their griefe: as if a woman hath loſt her onely ſonne in wars; then to mittigate her ſorrowe, they will ſhewe her, that death apprehendeth all men ſooner or later; it is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute muſt bee payde; this worlde yeeldeth nothing but miſerie; happier are they that depart from it, than thoſe that enioy it; his death was glorious, for his Countrey, for his Prince, the which among valiant captaynes, and noble mindes, hath alwayes beene prized above tenne thouſand lives; if he had dyed an infarnous death, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21840:35"/> treaſon, for rapine, for iniuſtice, then ſhee might have iuſtly lamented; but in dying for iuſtice, for obedience, for vertue, with glory, ſhe hath rather an exceeding oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ioy, than a motive of griefe. All which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions (as you ſee) tende to no other ende, but to rectifie her iudgement, and to repreſent vnto the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, thoſe reaſons which might rebate the paſſion of ſorrowe, concealed from it, by the ſtrong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe things which might encreaſe her griefe. Beſides, the vehemencie of the paſſion continueth the force of our imagination, becauſe, whatſoever paſſeth by the gates of our ſenſes, preſently entreth into the court of our imagination, where the ſenſitive appetite doth entertaine it: therefore, ſeeing all paſſions cauſe ſome ſence or feeling, more or leſſe in the body, ſo long as they endure, the imagination likewiſe repreſenteth to the vnderſtanding, ſo long the obiect of the paſſion, and as a deceitfull Counſellor, corrupteth his Iudge.</p>
                     <p>The laſt reaſon, which importeth more then both the other, proceedeth from a naughty will, for that the ſoule, hauing rooted in it, theſe two partes, ſenſitive and reaſonable: the will perceiving that the ſoule reioyceth, ſhe alſo contenteth herſelfe, that the inferior appetite ſhould enioy her pleaſure, or eſchew her griefe, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or againſt reaſon, ſhe careth not, ſo ſhe may be made partaker: as the great Turke permitteth every one to live in his Religion, ſo they pay him tribute. And for this cauſe ſhe commandeth the witte to employ all the power and force, to finde out reaſons and perſwaſions that all the appetite demaundeth, ſtandeth with reaſon and is lawfull; the which colluſion, I take to be one of the rootes of all miſchiefes, that nowe cover the face of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21840:36"/> the world, that is, a wicked will commanding the wit, to finde out reaſons to pleade for Paſſions: for this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth, yea wholy deſtroyeth the remorce of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the carefull gardian of the ſoule: this maketh men obſtinate in all enormious vices; for when the witte is once perſwaded, and no further appellation can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then the ſoule is confirmed almoſt in malice; this maketh ſo many Atheiſts, for <hi>vinum &amp; mulieres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatare</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21840:36"/> inordinate Paſſions cauſe and ingenerate in the ſoule, all thoſe vices which are oppoſite to prudence. The firſt is <hi>Precipitation,</hi> or Raſhneſſe, which is nothing elſe, but<note place="margin">Precipitation.</note> an vncircumſpect, or vnripe reſolution or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in affaires or negotiations: for the iudgement being blinded with the Paſſion, conſidereth not exactly, for the importance of the buſineſſe, thoſe circumſtances, which may withdraw it from the proſecution of ſuch a vitious action. I remember that when I was in Italy, there was a Scottiſh Gentleman, of moſt rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar partes, who was a Retainer to a Duke of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, hee was a ſingular good Scholler, and as good a Souldier; it chanced one night, the yong Prince, either vpon ſome ſpleene, or falſe ſuggeſtion, or to trie the Scots valour, mette him in a place where hee was wont to haunt, reſolving eyther to kill, wound, or beate him, and for this effect, conducted with him, two of the beſt Fencers hee could finde, the Scot had but one friende with him; in fine, a quarrell is pickt, they all draw, the Scot preſently ranne one of the Fencers thorow, and killed him in a trice, with that hee bended his forces to the Prince, who fearing, leaſt that which was befallen his Fencer, might happen vpon himſelfe, he exclaimed out inſtantly, that he was the Prince, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, to looke about him what he did: the Scot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyving well what he was, fell downe vpon his knees, demaunding pardon at his handes, and gave the Prince his naked rapier, who no ſooner had receyved it, but with the ſame ſword he ranne him thorow to death: the which barbarous fact, as it was condemned of all men, ſo it ſheweth the Precipitation of his paſſionate irefull heart: for if hee had conſidered the humble ſubmiſſion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21840:37"/> of his ſervant, and loyaltie of his ſubiect, and valour of his ſouldier; if he had weighed the cowardlineſſe of his fact, the infamie that hee ſhould thereby incurre, hee would never have precipitated into ſo ſavage an offence. But if with overmuch raſhneſſe a man contemne or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any Lawe, preferring his paſſionate iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſcript of lawe and reaſon, then his headdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is termed Temeritie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond vice is <hi>Inconſtancie,</hi> which is a change<note place="margin">Inconſtancie.</note> or alteration of that purpoſe or reſolution, which a man had prudently determined before. And this we may daily try in al incontinent perſons, who reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the calme of their paſſions never to fal into their former filthineſſe, but preſently, when the Paſſion ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, all the good reſolutions are forgotten, and that which an vnpaſſionate mind deteſted, a paſſionate ſoule moſt effectually purſueth.

                     <p>Moreover, the Will, by yeelding to the Paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyveth ſome little bribe of pleaſure, the which moveth her, to let the bridle looſe, vnto inordinate appetites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath ingrafted in her, two inclinations; the one to follow Reaſon, the other to content the Sences: and this inclination (the other beeing blinded by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt iudgement, cauſed by inordinate Paſſions) here ſhe feeleth ſatisfied.

                     <p>Two ſortes of Paſſions affect all men, ſome (as wee ſayde before) dilate, and ſome compreſſe and reſtringe the heart: Of the firſt was ſayd, <hi>Vita carninum est cordis</hi>

                        <hi>ſanitas,</hi> the life of fleſh, is the health of heart; for indeed, a ioyfull and quiet heart reviveth all the partes of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21840:39"/> body: Of the other was written, <hi>Spiritus tristis exſiccat</hi>
                        <note place="margin">prb. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>oſſa:</hi> a ſadde Spirit dryeth the bones. And for that all Paſſions bring with them ioy or payne, dilate or coarct the heart; therefore I thinke it not amiſſe, to declare the reaſon, why theſe two Paſſions worke ſuch alterations in the body, to the end, that by the knowledge of them, we may attayne to the vnderſtanding of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſure and Delight, if it bee moderate, bringeth health, becauſe the purer ſpirites retyre vnto the heart, and they helpe marvellouſly the digeſtion of blood, ſo that thereby the heart engendreth great aboundance, and moſt purified ſpirites, which after being diſperſed thorow the body, cauſe a good concoction to be made in all partes, helping them to expel the ſuperfluities; they alſo cleare the braine, and conſequently, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: For although while the Paſſion endureth, it blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a little the indifferent iudgement, yet after that it is paſt, it rendereth the brayne better diſpoſed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repreſent, whatſoever occurreth for ſpeculation. From good concoction, expulſion of ſuperſluities, and aboundance of ſpirites, proceedeth a good colour, a cleere countenance, and an vniverſall health of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But if the Paſſion of pleaſure bee too vehement, queſtionleſſe it cauſeth great infirmitie: for the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually invironed with great abundance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becommeth too hote and inflamed, and conſequently engendereth much cholericke and burned blood: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it dilateth and reſolveth the ſubſtance of the heart too much, in ſuch ſort, as the vertue and force thereof is greatly weakened. Wherefore <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to ſay, that thoſe men, which live continently and frugally, had more pleaſure, and leſſe payne, than thoſe, who with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21840:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> great care procured inticements to pleaſure; becauſe intemperate pleaſures, beſides the remorce of minde, infamie, and povertie, which waiteth vpon them, for the moſt part, hurt more the body, than delight it. And ſome, with too vehement laughter have ended their dayes; as <hi>Philemon</hi> did. <hi>Plutarch</hi> recounteth alſo, howe<note place="margin">Eraſm. lib. 6. Apotheg. Plutarch. in Hannib.</note> the Romanes, leeſing to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> newes was brought to Rome, and ſpecially to two women, that their ſonnes were ſlaine: afterwards, a remnant of the ſouldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, theſe two afflicted, ranne with many more, to know the manner of their ſonnes deaths, and amongſt the reſt, found them both alive, who for ioy, gave vp their ghoſts. And vniverſally, after much pleaſure and laughter, men feele themſelves both to languiſh, and to be melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Paſſions which coarct the heart, as feare, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deſpayre, as they bring more payne to the minde, ſo they are more dangerous to the body; and commonly, men proove leſſe harme in thoſe, than in theſe: and many have loſt their lives with ſadneſſe and feare; but few, with love and hope, except they changed themſelves into heavineſſe and deſpayre. The cauſe why ſadneſſe doth ſo moove the forces of the body, I take to be, the gathering together of much melancholy blood about the heart, which collection extinguiſheth the good ſpirits, or at leaſt dulleth them; beſides, the heart being poſſeſſed by ſuch an humour, cannot digeſt well the blood and ſpirites, which ought to be diſperſed thorow the whole body, but converteth them into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, the which humour being colde and drie, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole body, and maketh it wither away; for colde extinguiſheth heate, and dryneſſe moyſture,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21840:40"/> which two qualities principally concerne life.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Paſſions prevayle often ſo much with men, that they languiſh away and die: as it befell to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> in Spaine, the Generall to the Kinges Navie againſt the Frenchmen, who had taken the <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi> and <hi>D. Diego di Padiglia,</hi> the Governour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Millan,</hi> who receyving certayne wordes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace from the King of Spaine, they permitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo ore-ruled with the melancoly Paſſion, that they ſcarce could chawe their meate and ſwallowe it downe; at leaſt, they never made good digeſtion, and ſo with an vngracious death, they ended their diſgraced life.</p>
                     <p>Queſtionleſſe, this vehement ſorte of Paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from an high, prowde, and ambitious minde, and without all doubt, extraordinarie ſelfe-love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which, although by Gods Lawe they are prohibited, yet by the vayne humours of men, ſuch ſpirites are highly prized. I remember that in Italy, after the yeere, one thouſand five hundred eighty and eight, I heard divers Italian Captaines, greatly condemning the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> the King of Spaines Generall in his Navie againſt England, becauſe he dyed not of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, for that his Fleete miſcarried ſo baſely, and was foyled by the Engliſh Forces ſo eaſily. What Maladies growe by cares and heavineſſe, many can teſtifie, and fewe men there bee, which are not ſubiect to ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour, that often aſſaulteth them, troubling their mindes, and hurting their bodies; the olde Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians can witneſſe this veritie, confirmed by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and regiſtred in verſe, as a Medicine to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>

                     <p>To conclude, I am of opinion, that Paſſions cauſe many Maladies, and welnie all are increaſed by them, for that all payne engendreth melancholy; which, for the moſt part, nouriſheth all diſeaſes: for many we reade of that were cured by mirth, but never any by ſorrow or heavineſſe. When <hi>Alfonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of his Phyſitians, as in a deſperate caſe, then he called for <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> and tooke ſuch delight to heare him reade, that hee recovered his health agayne, and preſently reiected his Phyſitians, as not able to cure (by Phyſicke) that he obtained by alittle delight. This fact I cannot greatly commend, for Phyſicians and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines were ordained by God, and a wiſe man wil not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21840:41"/> deſpiſe them; it may bee, <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> pacified the Kinges melancholy minde, which no medicine could doe.</p>
                     <p>Yet there occurreth one poynt in this matter, not to be omitted, that Paſſions ingender Humors, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors breede Paſſions: how Paſſions cauſe Humors, we have hitherto ſufficiently declared; but how Humors ſtirre vp Paſſions, muſt now be delivered. We reade in the <hi>Machabees,</hi> how, before they led the Elephants to fight in warres, they accuſtomed to mingle iuyce of grapes and mulberies together, to ſharpen and incenſe them more to battell, and it ſeemeth a thing frequented in many Nations, to ſtirre vp beaſtes to fight, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome redde colour, for thereby they imagine, that the ſight of blood inflameth them to the ſhedding of blood: as in Spaine they vſe, when they chace their wild Bulles, and in Italy their Bufaloes. The true cauſe, why beaſtes are incenſed with a redde colour, <hi>Valeſius</hi> an excellent Phyſitian rendreth: for (ſaith he) the ſight of redde things (according to the common opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> and other Phyſitians) ſtirreth and inflameth the blood, therefore they prohibite thoſe which are much given to bleeding, to behold any redde colour. And I my ſelfe in Italy have heard Phyſitians commaund, that redde clothes, coveringes, and hangings ſhould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from before the patients, which were labouring in a tertian Agew; becauſe they affirmed, that red colours mooved and inflamed the blood. Now if the blood of Elephants, being incenſed with a red colour, had force to ſtirre in them the Paſſion of Ire in battell; how much more may we ſay, that if much hote blood abound in the body, that ſubiect, by the force of that Humor, ſhall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21840:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> eaſily, and often bee mooved to anger; if temperate blood abound, or be mingled with fleugme, to mirth; if melancholy exceede, to griefe and heavineſſe? And in effect we proove in dreames, and Phyſitians progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate by them, what humor aboundeth, for Choler cauſeth fighting, blood and wounds; Melancholy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, feares, affrightments, ill ſucceſſe, and ſuch like: theſe dreames are cauſed by the ſpirites, which aſcend into the imagination, the which being purer or groſſer, hotter or colder, more or leſſe, (which diverſitie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the humours of the bodie) moove divers Paſſions according to their Nature. And for this cauſe we may reſolve another difficulty, why ſome men are alwayes, almoſt merry; others, for the moſt part, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; others, ever angry: this diverſity muſt come from the naturall conſtitution of the body, wherein, one or other humor doth predominate. The ſelfe ſame cauſe may be alledged, why ſometimes wee feele our ſelves; we know not why, mooved to Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th, Melancholy, or Anger: inſomuch that any little occaſion were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to incenſe that Paſſion: for, as theſe humors depend vpon the heavens, ayre, ſleepe and waking, meate and drinke, exerciſe and reſt, according to the alterations of theſe externall cauſes; one or other Humor doth more or leſſe over-rule the body, and ſo cauſeth alteration of Paſſions.</p>
                     <p>Out of this diſcourſe, and the 9. Chapter, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſome prettie curious Queſtions, more talkt of and practiſed, then well vnderſtood.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, how can poſſibly a mans conceite worke ſtrange effectes in his body? As for example, <hi>Hypocrates</hi> exhorteth Phyſitians, if two kindes of meate were to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21840:42"/> be miniſtred to a Patient, the one healthfull, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little hurtful, or not ſo good as the other, that they ſhould preferre this being much deſired, before that not ſo well liked: and generally, both Philoſophers and Phyſitians maintayne, that the opinion of the Patient, of the Phyſitians knowledge, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Phiſicke, importeth much for the curing of any maladie. The reaſon is plaine (for theſe and ſuch like experiences) for the Imagination herein (though erroneouſly conceaving things better then indeede and really they are) cauſeth a vehement Paſſion of Hope, wherewith followeth an extraordinary Pleaſure in the things; which two Paſſions awake, or rowze vp the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Secondly, how S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> opinion may bee verified, who thinketh, that the Bulles with white ſpots, which continued ever among the Egyptians, and were adored for their god <hi>Apis,</hi> was ever engendred by the acte of<note place="margin">Aug. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And eſpecially this ought to bee practiſed by great Perſons, who never (almoſt) heare the trueth concerning their owne actions: for Flatterie fayneth falſhood: &amp; hope of gayne and preferment, mooveth them to prayſe vices for vertues. This Trueth might largely bee prooved, but that it is more palpable, by experience, than can be denyed.</p>
                     <p>It chanceth ſometimes, by Gods permiſſion, that our enemies (who prie into our actions and examine more narrowly our intentions then wee our ſelves) diſcover vnto vs better our Paſſions, and reveale our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then ever we our ſelves. As befell vnto S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> mother, the holy <hi>Monica,</hi> who, (as he relateth in his Confeſſions) being from her youth accuſtomed to drinke onely water, was after ſome time by her friendes and parents, cauſed to ſippe a little wine, and ſo by ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping little and little, ſhe came to ſuch a delight of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine, that ſhe would ſip off a prettie cuppe: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened one day, that the Maid of the houſe and ſhee fell at ſome wordes, and the Maid (according to womens faſhions) vpbrayded her with all the faultes ſhe knewe, and among the reſt expoſtulated this, calling her <hi>meribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulam,</hi> a toſ-pot, or tippler of pure wine: the godly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> conceyved ſuch an averſion from wine, and ſuch a ſhame by this expoſtulation, that ſhe never drunke any more all the dayes of her life.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, a good way to know the inclinations of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21840:49"/> mind, is like the manner we come by the knowledge of the inclinations of our bodies, that is, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For as we ſay, if a man, before fortie yeeres of age be not a good phyſition of his owne bodie, that is, if he know not whether his inclination bendeth, what doth him good, what bringeth harme, he deſerueth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred for a foole; euen ſo, he that in many yeares by continuall practiſe of his owne ſoule perceiueth not where his paſsions lie, in my iudgement, he ſcarce deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the name of a wiſe man: for as he may be begd for an ideot, who riding a horſe for tenne yeares, euery day from morning to night, and yet knoweth not the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his horſe, and the vices whereunto he is ſubiect; ſo he which euery day manageth his owne ſoule, if after tenne yeeres labour he cannot find whither the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tend, he may well be thought either very vitious, or very ſimple.</p>

If thou tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly perceiue thy paſsions to exceed the common courſe, then looke to the end of the 16. chapter, where
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21840:50"/> thou ſhalt ſee how hard they are to be reyned, and what great, yea and extreame difficultie they caſt vpon thee againſt vertue and goodneſſe, and then thou mayeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe few rules.</p>
                     <p>Euery moderat paſsion bordureth betwixt two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, as liberalitie betwixt auarice and prodigalitie; temperat diet betwixt gluttonie and ſcarcitie; fortitude betwixt deſperat boldneſſe and ſuperfluous feare, called timiditie. Men commonly by nature are more enclined to one of theſe extreames than another, as moſt men are giuen to couetouſneſſe, few to prodigalitie; more to eat too much, than to eat too little; more to be afraid when they need not, than to be too bold when they ought to be afraid. If then thou trie thy ſelfe, not vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to any of theſe paſsions, yet ſometimes to exceed in one extreame, ſometime in another; commonly the ſecureſt way to be practiſed, is to incline thy ſelfe to that extreame which men by nature moſt vehemently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, as prodigalitie, ſcarceueſle in diet, boldneſſe in daungers. But if thou perceiue a vehement inclination to the one extreame, procure to bend thy ſelfe as farre to the other; for ſo thou ſhalt with more facilitie come to the middeſt: as commonly the Philoſophers declare, by the example of a crooked ſtaffe, the which to make ſtraight, we bend to the other ſide, and make it as croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contrariwiſe as it was before.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond rule to moderate paſsions, we may learne<note place="margin">Solus in illicitis non cadit, qui ſe aliquando &amp; a licitis caute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringit. Gregor. lib. 5. moral. &amp; hom. 35. ſuper Euan.</note> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who to bridle extraordinarie and vnlawfull pleaſures, was accuſtomed to abſtaine from lawfull and not prohibited: For if one be addicted to drunkenneſſe, he ſhall with more facilitie ouercome this paſsion, if he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21840:50"/> abſtaine from ſtrong drinkes, he moſt affecteth, euen at ſuch times as lawfully he may vſe them.</p>
                     <p>The third rule to flie occaſions, which may incenſe the paſsion whereunto we are inclined: for <hi>occaſiones fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctunt latrones,</hi> a commodious and fit occaſion to ſteale, maketh oftentimes theeues, which otherwiſe would haue been honeſt men: wherefore he that committeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſea in a boiſterous tempeſt, deſerueth to ſuffer ſhipwrack, &amp; he that willingly without neceſsitie dealeth with infected perſons, may blame himſelfe if he fall into their diſeaſes: ſo hee that is giuen to laſciuiouſneſſe, and vſeth riotous companie, may condemne his owne wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if his paſsions rebell and ouercome him. For this cauſe God commaunded that the Nazarites which were conſecrated to him, ſhould drinke no Wine, not any thing that might cauſe drunkenneſſe; and leaſt they ſhould, by eating grapes or great reiſins be allured to the<note place="margin">Num 6.</note> drinking of wine, he commaunded them, they ſhould neither eat grapes nor reiſins: So, hee that will not bee guided by affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, muſt diligently auoid occaſions. Yet this rule ought not to be vnderſtood vniuerſally, for it is conuenient to find out occaſions to exerciſe ſome paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to ſeeke the poore, to practiſe the paſsion of pitie; to viſit the ſick, to ſhew compaſsion; to exerciſe learning, to ouercome feare. But in ſuch paſsions as Nature more than willingly would follow, beſt it were to flie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as he that will liue chaſt, muſt eſchew much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie with ſuſpected perſons, and vniuerſally with all women; not looking vpon them, nor touching, except neceſsitie, or good manners, in ſome few caſes requireth. The ſame may be ſaid of gluttonie, pride, and ſuch like,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21840:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> whereunto our corrupt nature is much inclined: yet if ſome man by experience haue prooued ſuch paſsions not to be very rebellious, and that for moſt part he hath ouerruled them, he may be ſomething the bolder: yet let him not be too confident, for the Fox often ſeemes to be dead, to ſeize more aſſuredly vpon his prey.</p>
                     <p>The fourth remedie, for noble ſpirits ſingular; of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer mindes abhorred, yet of both worthie to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may be drawne out of the very poyſon of paſsions, that is, when a moſt vehement and rebellious motion aſſaulteth thee, when the fierceneſſe and tyrannie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of welnigh poſſeſſeth thee, when thou art almoſt yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſent vnto it: then turne the force of thy ſoule with as much indeauour as thou canſt to the contrarie, and with one naile driue out another; make of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 11. 2. Cor. 8. 9.</note> a benefit, let vertue in infirmitie and weakeneſſe of reſiſtance be more perfit, and ennobled: For as in warres the valianteſt ſouldiours in greateſt incounters are beſt tried, ſo in moſt vehement paſsions, the reſoluteſt minds are beſt prooued. For <hi>Ioſephs</hi> chaſtitie had neuer been ſo glorious, if his vnchaſt ladie had not ſo vehemently allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to defile the bed of his lord. <hi>Iobs</hi> patience had neuer been ſo conſpicuous, if the paſsion of griefe and ſadneſſe had not ſo violently ſeized vpon him. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> fortitude had neuer beene ſo heroicall, if the death of his onely ſonne had not cut in a manner his heart ſtrings aſunder.</p>
                     <p>This meane, to mortifie paſsions, I take to be one of the moſt forcible and important remedies that men can vſe, eſpecially for two cauſes: the firſt, for that by theſe contrarie acts are bred in the ſoules, certaine habites,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21840:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> helpes, ſtayes, or inclinations moſt oppoſite vnto our paſsions; and therefore the paſsions being ſtrong, they cannot be ouercommed, but by the might of excellent vertue: for as the deeper a tree is rooted in the ground, it requireth greater force to pull it vp; euen ſo, the greater poſſeſsion the paſsion hath taken of the ſoule, the greater vertue it needeth to ſupplant it. It ſeemeth that <hi>Iob,</hi> after<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 15.</note> ſo many temptations, practiſed this remedie, when he ſaid, <hi>Etiamſi occideret me, in ipſo ſperabo.</hi> Although God kill me, yet I will hope in him: For queſtionleſſe, thoſe pains and pangs did incite him to deſperation; the which, with contrarie truſt in God he moſt valiantly ſuppreſſed. Another cauſe may be yeelded, for that many paſsions proceed, not onely from the inclinations of nature, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humours, but by the very ſuggeſtion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who watcheth his oportunitie, to take men at an aduantage, and to induce them to ſundry inordinat affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for which cauſe, they are called very often in Scriptures, vncleane ſpirits, becauſe they leade men into vncleane paſsions and actions. The diuell therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his temptations ſo valiantly reſiſted, his poyſoned darts rebounding into his owne breaſt, I meane his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions redound to his owne ſhame and confuſion, dareth not be ſo bold another time to inuade ſo ſtrong a ſort, but with all his troupe will flie from it, as a ſwarme of filthie flies dare not approch neere vnto a boyling pot, <hi>Reſiſtite diabolo, &amp; fugiet à vobis,</hi> reſiſt the diuell, and he<note place="margin">Iames 4. 7.</note> will flie from you.</p>
                     <p>The fift remedie, not inferiour to the precedent, is to reſiſt paſsions at the beginning: vſe the remedie for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> practiſed for tyrannie, in killing all the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21840:52"/> infants of the Iews, leaſt they ſhould encreaſe too much, and ſo ouerrun his countrey: While the ſore is greene, ſeldome ſurgeons deſpaire, but feſtred once, they hardly cure it: ſo paſsions, while they knocke at the doore of our mindes, whileſt they are a little entertained, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them not quickly, they will allodge longer with you than you would haue them. And the moſt eaſie way of all, and by ſpirituall men daily put in vre, is to diuert the thoughts to ſome other obiect: for as we vſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conuerſation, when two be brawling about any thing, to diuert their talke to another matter; (for, as long as they continue about the ſame ſubiect, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall into the ſame inconuenience) ſo the beſt way to expell an inordinate paſsion, is, to tranſport the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome other matter; as he that will be rid of an ill gueſt, the worſe he entertaineth him, the ſooner he ſhall be diſpatched of him: and for this cauſe, when any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion oppreſſeth a man, thoſe who are addicted to ſtudie, haue great aduantage of others, becauſe they may diuert their mindes eaſily with their Bookes.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt remedie to mortifie paſsions, is, to bridle the bodie, that is, to chaſtiſe it, according to that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paule: Caſtigo corpus meum, &amp; in ſeruitutem redigo</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Corin. 9. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>ne, cum alijs praedicauero ipſe reprobus efficiar.</hi> I chaſtiſe my bodie, and bring it into ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ruitude, leaſt I that preach to others, become reprobat. For queſtionleſſe, he that pampereth his bodie, ſeedeth his enemie, and he that will feede it with dainties, cannot but find it rebellious; for this we ſee in wild beaſts, That the beſt way to tame them, is by ill vſage: pamper a horſe, and you ſhall haue him too wanton; pamper your fleſh, and it will ouerrule
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21840:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> you. And he that will mortifie his paſsions, and let his bodie flow with delicacies, doth like him which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh fire by adding more fewell. Therefore faſting, praying, lying hard, courſe ſhirts, pinching cold, much ſtudie, and ſuch auſterities, are foements of vertue, and bane of paſsions: and in fine, how much the more with reaſon and prudence we afflict this rebellious fleſh, we make it ſo much the more a fitter inſtrument for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, vertue, and all goodneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth remedie, requireth a reſolute good will and endeuour to attaine vnto this perfit gouernment of a mans ſelfe: whence from will follow a diligent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortification; for ſuch a man will not ceaſe daily and inceſſantly to demaund grace and fauour of God to ouercome his rebellious nature, reſiſt temptations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all falſe allurements of this inticing world: Such an one will examine daily his conſcience, and note what thoughts, words, or deeds, againſt God himſelfe, and his neighbour, he hath committed, whereby either vertue is extinguiſhed, or vice increaſed: Such an one will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the morning when he riſeth, not to let paſſe that day, without the extirpating of ſome ſtinking and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned thorne, and planting ſome ſweet and pleaſant flower, within the garden of his ſoule: Such an one will not onely preuent occaſions, but alſo arme himſelfe as well as he can to reſiſt ſuch tentations as he knoweth eſpecially ſhall be offered in certaine places and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which he cannot conueniently auoid.</p>
                     <p>To this helpeth greatly the conſideration of that ſmall pleaſure paſsions doe yeeld; for, almoſt, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are commenced, practiſed, and paſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21840:53"/> much better it were to croſſe them a little, and win a crowne of glorie, than to pleaſe them a moment, to be condemned to hell.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, but chiefely, when thy paſsions are moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, then ſeeke for ſuccour from Heauen, flie vnder the wings of Chriſt, as the chickens vnder their henne, when the kite ſeeketh to deuour them: beate at the gates of his mercie, craue grace to ouercome thy miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. He is thy Father, and will not giue thee a ſerpent, if thou aske him a fiſh: humble thy ſelfe before him, open thy ſores and wounds vnto him, and the good Samaritane will poure in both wine and oyle; and then thou ſhalt ſee thy paſsions melt and fall away as clouds are conſumed by the Sunne.</p>

                     <p>Two ſorts of prudence we may vſe concerning paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21840:53"/> the one how to behaue and carrie our ſelues when we are troubled with them; the other, how to deale with others, when we perceiue they are poſſeſſed of them: the firſt I will call prudence in paſsions; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, pollicie. The former I meane to handle here, the latter, in the next chapter.</p>
                     <p>The firſt point of prudence which all prudent men confeſſe and obſerue, is to perſuade our ſelues when we are mooued with a vehement paſsion, that our ſoules are then, as it were, infected with a peſtilent ague, which both hindereth the ſight of our eyes, and the taſt of our tongues, that is, corrupteth the iudgement, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the will; that as certaine ſpectacles make moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſeeme mole-hils, and others, mole-hils like mountaines; euen ſo, paſsions make the paſsionate to iudge all thoſe things which tend to the fauour of his paſsion, reaſonable, great, and worthie, and all that ſtands againſt it, baſe, vile, and naughtie, as in the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was declared.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon followeth, that at what time the paſsion is aflote, and raigneth, it were not good to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or determination of change: for ſome I haue ſeene ſo vehement in their paſsions, that whatſoeuer was ſuggeſted them, either by the diuell, or their paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they preſently would put it in execution: I doe thinke there be few men liuing, which haue not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot themſelues in this point, and repented when their ſoules were calmed, that they committed, when they were tempeſted.</p>
                     <p>The moſt part of the world is bewitched with this ſorcerie; for what wicked reſolutions attempt the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21840:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the very dregs of their anger? What deſperat words flie? What fields are pitched in the heat of ire? How many kill, drowne, and hang themſelues in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie and deſperations? What fornications, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceſts, and other beaſtialities are effected in the furious flame of fleſhly luſt? All the world can witneſſe, which I thinke to be too too ſufficient proofe; wherfore <hi>Architas</hi> did wiſely, when he found his ſeruants in the field, to haue committed once a fault, and perceiuing himſelfe to be greatly mooued therewithall, he would not beat them in his ire, but ſaid: <hi>Fortunati eſtis quod iraſcor vobis,</hi> Happie are you that I am angrie with you, for otherwiſe hee would haue beaten them. <hi>Cicero 4. Tuſcul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Athenedorus,</hi> a wiſe Philoſopher, departing from <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and bidding him farewell, he left this leſſon with him, moſt worthie to be printed in an Emperours breaſt, That when he was angrie, he ſhould neither ſpeake nor doe any thing, before he had recited the foure and twentie names of the Greeke Alphabet: The which leſſon <hi>Caeſar</hi> receiued as a moſt pretious iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. <hi>Plutarch in Apoph.

It impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth queſtionleſſe greatly, a graue mans credite, a great mans authoritie, and a ciuile mans good conuerſation, to be ſubiect to ſome one only inordinate paſsion: for ſuch a corrupt iudgement hath now ſo much preuailed with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21840:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> men, yea, and euer hath ben, that they will contemne the whole, for ſome one notable defect: as for example, if we ſee a picture of a man or woman, drawne with exquiſit colours, great proportion, and art; yet, if there be but one eye, one arme, yea or one finger out of ſquare, men will ſay, the image is ſpoyled, for that one defect; yea, the firſt thing almoſt we marke, is the improportion or diſquaring of that part.</p>
                     <p>How many prize, almoſt nothing, their geldings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lacke their tailes, eares, mane, or good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? Euen ſo, we trie by dayly talke, that commonly men deſcant vpon other mens doings; they will ſay, ſuch a nobleman is reſolute in warres, goodly in perſon; but ſubiect to choller, too much addicted vnto his owne iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excelleth in learning, yea but pride ouerruleth him; ſuch a Senatour iudgeth profoundly, but is impatient in hearing of cauſes; ſuch a man raigneth in the Pulpit, but blinded with couetouſneſſe; ſuch a man paſſeth in Muſicke, but is buried, for the moſt part, in the tauerne; ſuch a man giueth great almes, but attendeth too much to good cheere; and in fine, there is no man ſo well qualified, but alwayes the world will condemne him, becauſe they iudge him ſtained with ſome paſsion: therefore great prudence wiſemen account it, for graue and great perſons, not to lay their paſsions open to the cenſure of the world. Many inconueniences may follow, if others know what paſsions men are ſubiect vnto; for if thy enemies would bee reuenged of thee, no fitter meanes they might ſleightly vſe, than to procure ſome way whereby thy paſsions ſhould be ſtirred and put in execution; for by often miniſtring matter, thy paſsions

Nay, quoth the Dutchman, without any man, I would deſtroy a troupe of Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, onely by ſending againſt them a multitude of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for they might eaſily make of them a maſſacre like <hi>Paris,</hi> or an euenſong of <hi>Sicilie</hi> at midnight in their beds.

The way may be thus: in great aſſemblies, or at ſuch times as moſt men

                     <p>The third point may be, Not to vex and trouble thy ſelfe too much whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a paſsion ſeizeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, but diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy mind from it, and reſtraining thy conſent as well as thou canſt from yeelding vnto it; and in ſhort time thou ſhalt ſee it vanniſh away: as wee prooue in daily temptations of ire, ſadneſſe, loue, luſt, and ſuch like, which fall and conſume away euen by themſelues: either becauſe the humour which was mooued, returneth to his former ſeat, or the impreſsion made in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deminiſheth, or the attention of the ſoule deſtracted with other matters, faileth, or ſome other paſsion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth it, or the deuill ceaſeth to tempt; either (I ſay) all theſe, or moſt of them mittigat, conſume, and wholy ſubuert that paſsion which before ſo troubled vs, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med inſuperable.</p>
                     <p>The fourth poynt which ought principally to bee conſidered, and well waighed of thoſe whoſe paſsions are moſt vehement and inordinate, is this, that they which perceiue in themſelues ſuch diſordered affections, ought firſt to know the root of them to bee ſelfe-loue, and the greater they find the boughs of their paſsions, the greater and deeper root let them bee aſſured lieth hidden vnder the bottome of their ſoule: for which cauſe ſuch men muſt perſuade themſelues to haue great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to vertue, and extreame facilitie to vice: that as they loue pleaſures of the body exceedingly, ſo they hate all that may hinder or oppoſe it ſelfe thereunto mightily. That they bee blinded as battes in their owne conceits, apprehending that they loue or hate, farre differently
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21840:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> from that it is in very deed; that they bee commonly too raſh, attempting greater enterpriſes than their forces are able to performe, and for the moſt part more bold than wiſe, guiding their actions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> not by reaſon and iudgement, but by harebraine affections: and as they are headlong and obſtinat when ſtrong paſsions poſſeſſe them, ſo are they irreſolute and inconſtant when a weake affection dooth mooue them: for being accuſtomed to follow their appetites, as long as they continue they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in one mood; but after the weeke paſsion is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, their iudgements and determinations are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men ought to bee wonderfull warie in their words, and circumſpect in their actions, alwayes hauing themſelues ſuſpected: wherefore I would perſuade them, firſt to craue of God helpe and grace, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo hard a nature: ſecondly, to conferre with wiſe and diſcreet men about their owne affaires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, rather relying vpon them, than their owne iudgements: which counſell <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue, ſaying, <hi>Fili, ne innitaris prudentiae tuae.</hi> Sonne, be not married to thy<note place="margin">Prou. 3. 5.</note> owne wiſdome.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince men by nature are addicted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and one dependeth vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, therefore it importeth much, to know how to ſecond or croſſe other mens affections, how we may pleaſe or diſpleaſe them, make them our friends or foes. But becauſe this ſubiect is infinite, I will only ſet downe certaine generall rules, whereby ſome ſmall light may be had, how to liue and deale with men, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that loue, peace, and charitie be conſerued: for good Chriſtians ought not onely to procure an vnion with God, but alſo an amitie with men: and the world being greene in mallice, and withered in goodneſſe, men more guided by paſsions, than ruled by reaſon, therefore the wiſer ought to prouide a ſalue proportionated to the ſore, and meanes to preuent mallice; leaſt the children of darkeneſſe in prudence ſurpaſſe the children of light, ſeeing our Maiſter taught vs, how the cic of a doue ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth beſt the ſerpents head.</p>
                     <p>The firſt rule may be this. All men (commonly) are pleaſed with them, whom they ſee affected with thoſe paſsions whereunto they are ſubiect and inclined. This rule, both experience teacheth, and reaſon prooueth.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21840:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> We ſee that lyons, tygres, and leopards, whoſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are moſt cruell, whoſe paſsions moſt fierce, yet one affecteth another and liueth in quiet ſocietie, for the ſimilitude of inclinations, and likelineſſe of paſsions. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> asked a pyrat that was taken and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, How he durſt be ſo bold to infeſt the ſeas, and ſpoyle the commerceries? he anſwered, That he played the pyrat but with one ſhip, and his Maieſtie with a huge nauie: the which ſaying ſo pleaſed <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he pardoned his life, and graunted him libertie: ſo much could the ſimilitude of action tranſport the kings affection. The reaſon alſo of this rule may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: becauſe all likelineſſe cauſeth loue, and as euery one iudgeth, he doth the beſt, or at leaſt, approoueth well; euen ſo, he cannot diſprooue, but allow the ſame in others. Hereupon followeth, that if thou wilt pleaſe thy maſter or friend, thou muſt apparrell thy ſelfe with his affections, and loue where he loueth, and hate where he hateth: and vniuerſally, to ſooth other mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, plaineth the way to friendſhip and amitie: and as this meane foſtereth flatterie, if it be abuſed, ſo it nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth charitie, if it be well vſed.</p>
                     <p>Out of this rule we may deduce the ſecond, which ought no leſſe to be obſerued in conuerſation than the former, That men commonly hate thoſe whome they know to be of contrarie paſsions: whereupon procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that common Prouerbe, He that hateth whome I loue, how can he loue me? for as fire with fire doe neuer iarre, ſo fire and water can neuer agree. But in the next Booke, which ſhall be of Loue, I pretend to diſcuſſe better this rule, becauſe, as ſimilitude cauſeth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21840:58"/> loue, ſo diſsimilitude breedeth hatred. Therefore I omit to declare how ſometimes likelineſſe of paſsions engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth contention, as we ſay, <hi>Figulus figulum odit,</hi> one potter hateth another; and, <hi>Inter ſuperbos ſemper ſunt iurgia;</hi> among prowd men there are euer brawlings: for if ſimilitude of paſsions preiudicateth profit, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of affections cauſeth diſſention.</p>
                     <p>The third rule. Be not too credulous to men in their owne cauſes: for as ſelfe-loue for the moſt part conceiues what appertaineth to our ſelues, with a greater ſhew of good and honeſtie, than indeed the thing carrieth with it; ſo, men mooued therewith, declare the matter as they conceiue it: for words ſpring from conceits, theſe are the tree, thoſe the flowers and leaues, which doe follow by iuſt proportion.

Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, others mens matters, which hinder our profit or croſſe our deſignes, for the moſt part wee extenuat and abaſe. As in Italie once befell to a number of wiſe men, who heard an Oration, wherein they were all welnigh perſuaded: but the next day came vp another Oratour, and told a contrarie tale, and changed their minds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them all to the other part; for which cauſe we may adioyne the fourth rule.</p>
                     <p>The fourth rule. When you are induced to any thing by act, that is, by a tale well told in Rhetoricall manner, flexibilitie of voyce, geſtures, action, or other oratoricall perſuaſions; good I hold it a while, for a man to ſuſpend
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21840:58"/> his iudgement, and not to permit his will follow too farre his motion, more artificiall than naturall, grounded vpon affection rather than reaſon: For that ſaying of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ought well to be weighed, who being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what was Rhetorike; anſwered, to make great things little, and little, great: wherefore, after <hi>Aeſchines</hi> was<note place="margin">Eraſm. libr. 8.

By this example we ſee proued, that commonly wiſe Rhetoricians affirme, that Rhetorike in an ill cauſe, is a two edged ſword in the hand of a furious man. Yet I would not by this condemne the facultie of eloquence, which I confeſſe, if it be well vſed, to be moſt profitable for the Church and common-weale: but becauſe at this preſent it is ſophiſticated, by many, who couer ſtincking matters with fragrant flowers, and with a few ſugred words temper the gall of their pernicious obiects; therefore euery wiſe man ought rather to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Orators reaſons, than to follow his intent with a ſeduced affection.</p>
                     <p>The fift rule. When men are poſſeſſed of a vehement paſsion, deale not with them by reprehenſion or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, eſpecially in vehement manner, except it be ſome perſon that is ſuperior, or in authoritie, but rather by a mild and ſoft ſort of perſuaſion. The reaſon of this rule may well be gathered out of that wee haue hitherto deliuered: for contrarie paſsions breed hatred and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21840:59"/> wherefore hee that is paſsionat, will hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by him whom hee conceiueth contrarie to him: yea often thoſe that at other times were good friendes, in time of paſsions for ſome ſuch oppoſition, fall into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe contention; for as we ſee, when a houſe in the midſt of the ſtreete is vehementlie inflamed, it were bootleſſe to quench the flame with water, but the beſt remedie, and commonly practiſed, is to pull downe the next houſes, that thereby the lacke of foement might diminiſh the flame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſo, him that rageth with anger, hardly you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe by wrangling or chiding; but either anſwere mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for <hi>Mollis reſponſio mitigat iram,</hi> a ſoft anſwere mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth anger: or, aunſwere nothing, withdrawing the matter of anger from ſight: the ſame in vehement luſt or ſadnes may bee practiſed, as in the particular Treatiſes ſhall be deliuered.</p>
                     <p>This rule holdeth vniuerſally in all thoſe which be our equalles, or at the leaſt doe not much exceed vs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or wee them. But if a ſuperiour, or a magiſtrat ſee his inferior, or ſubiect, vehemently caried in any paſsion, he may threaten, or reprehend him, becauſe one paſsion often cureth another: ſo here the paſsion of feare may expell the paſsion of anger, luſt, or what elſe ſoeuer tempteth, either to the paſsionats euill, or any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the common-weale: albeit, if the paſsion tend not preſently to ſome ſinne or great offence, better I hold it to deferre ſuch reprehenſions till the ſubiect be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt rule. No man ought to be employed to any office, act, or exerciſe, contrarie to his naturall paſsions and inclination. This rule concerneth all ſorts of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21840:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the imployments of their ſubiects, all parents for the education of their children, ſchoolemaiſters for the training vp of their ſchollers. The ground of this rule dependeth of long experience, and reaſon. For by experience we learne, that men be oftentimes imployed to one trade, and neuer can profit therein: contrariwiſe, when either they of themſelues, or others, do change that courſe to another, whereunto they were inclined, they become very excellent men. I knew one in Flaunders imployed of his friends to be a marchant againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but he neuer ſcarce could abide to deale in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe: and ſo at laſt therwith awearied, left them, and turned his courſe to ſtudie, wherein he excelled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the rareſt preachers there; I my ſelfe heard him preach after, very godly and learnedly: a hundred ſuch examples I could bring you. Reaſon alſo prooueth the ſame moſt manifeſtly: for three things are required of neceſsitie, to attaine to the perfection of any ſcience, cunning, or office; Nature, Art, &amp; practiſe: Nature affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth capacitie of wit, ſtrength of bodie, and inclination of mind; the which inclination, if it be lacking, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſtriueth againſt the ſtreame, and although by force and conſtraint, <hi>nolens, volens,</hi> he follow ſuch a trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his mind, he may peraduenture doe ſome thing with great difficultie, the which labor if he had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that thing whereunto he was inclined, he would haue become a moſt excellent man.</p>
                     <p>This rule may not be vnderſtood ſo abſolutely, but that it admitteth ſome limitation; for ſome contrarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or paſsion proceedeth not from defect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or abilitie of mind, but from an ill and vitious ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21840:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> or wilfulneſſe: and then it were good with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inticements to allure ſuch a perſon to follow that ſcience, art, or trade, whereunto nature moſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him. Another exception is, if the impediments of Nature bee but ſmall, and the habiliments otherwiſe great, then the one ought to ouerrule the other; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little labour in ouercomming the impediment, will follow a great facilitie in the atchieuement of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth rule ſerueth for great perſons, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly neuer reſiſt their paſsions: therefore if a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand once their inordinat affections, he may be very well aſſured to haue gained much ground in preuailing with them. And therefore wee ſee vſually, that if men ſee ſuch perſons addicted to this or that affection, to win their good wils, they will foſter vp ſuch fancies; if they be delighted in muſicke, they preſent them with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if in riding with horſes, if in hunting with dogs, if in ſtudie with literall labours, &amp;c. for by thus feeding their fancies, they win their friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Finally, there be generall hinderances, common to all, or moſt men, to get vertue and learning, and thoſe ought by diligence and labor to be cut off; for the ſweet fruits of vertue ſpring from bitter rootes of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the praiſe of learning proceedeth from induſtrie and labour: therefore let no man perſuade himſelfe to attaine vnto any ſingular cunning, except his labour be ſingular.</p>
                     <p>Many more rules might be here deliuered, as that prowd men be pleaſed with praiſes, honor, and account; diſcontented with compariſons, with commending their equals, in not yeelding them honour, in diſparaging their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21840:60"/> actions. Milde, modeſt, humble, meeke, are beloued vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally, becauſe we thinke them vertuous, who will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or not contemne vs. If thou wouldeſt obtaine any fauour, or inuite any man to pleaſure, it were good to take him at ſuch times as he is merrily diſpoſed, as after meat. If thou wilt induce him to penſiueneſſe, ſorrow for his ſinnes, the feare of God, or any ſad paſsion, take him at ſuch times as melancholie moſt oppreſſeth him; in darke and cloudie dayes, in the morning, in Winter, or in fine, at ſuch ſeaſons as that paſsion raigneth ouer him. Theſe and many more I could ſet downe, but the order of method requireth they ſhould bee allotted to particular Treatiſes. Wherefore I will conclude this Chapter with this ſentence: That as hee is imprudent which hath ſtrong paſsions, and endeuoureth not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale them from others, ſo he may be accounted vnpolliticke, who knoweth another mans paſsions, and cannot preuaile againſt them.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21840:61"/> mortifie their paſsions, and craftie men diſſemble: yet we may for the moſt part attaine vnto the knowledge of them, for that moſt men follow the inſtinct of Nature, and few, either the precepts of reaſon, or exquiſit crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by which two meanes paſsions are concealed.

For that we cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mans heart, and view the paſsions or inclinations which there reſide and lie hidden; therefore, as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers by effectes find out cauſes, by proprieties eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by riuers fountaines, by boughs and floures the kore and rootes; euen ſo we muſt trace out paſsions and inclinations by ſome effects and externall operations. And theſe be no more than two, words &amp; deeds, ſpeech and action: of which two, knowledge may be gathered of thoſe affections we carry in our minds: therfore firſt I will entreate of words, and then of deeds.

By this may be gathered the reaſon why ianglers &amp; praters deſerue to be regiſtred in the catalogue of fooles, becauſe many fancies come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens minds, &amp; he that wil poure foorth all he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, deliuereth dregges with drinke; and as for the moſt part, preſently men apprehend more folly than wiſedom, ſo he that ſodainely vttereth all he vnderſtandeth, blab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth foorth more froath than good liquor: and thus, much ſpeech and haſtie, proceedeth from raſh fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the which paſsion raigneth, for the moſt part, in yong men, women, and doting proud old age.

This lingering may proceed from ſome impediment of the inſtruments of ſpeaking, a ſlowneſſe of conceiuing, or a certaine vaine conceit that men haue of their owne wiſedome, the which they would diſtill into other men, drop by drop, as water falleth from the Limbecke; for they thinke, if they doe vtter their words faſter, they ſhould ſpill ſome of their prudence. And indeed, among dull perſons of ſlow capacitie, I thinke it not farre amiſſe; except they linger ſo long, that before their ending, they forget their beginning: but amongſt perſons of good vnderſtanding, it argueth, either ſlowneſſe of wit, or contempt of their vnderſtanding, and it cannot be but maruellous moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them, like as if a man were extreamely thirſtie, and one ſhould giue him drinke by drops, which maner of deliuerie cannot but grieue him, although the drinke be neuer ſo excellent: euen ſo, men of quicke capacitie haue a ſharpe appetite, and would be preſently ſatisfied, wherefore long lingering in ſpeech hindereth greatly their naturall inclination and deſire. Yet for all this I muſt confeſſe, that in ſome maieſticall and very graue perſons, whoſe prudence and wiſedome men much admire, few words pithie and leiſurely ſpoken, argue both wiſedome, grauitie, and magnanimity, as afterwards in the paſsion of boldneſſe ſhall be declared.</p>

Amongſt a thouſand you ſhall ſcarſe finde one ripe in iudgement, or ſound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: theſe men doe ſpend their time and ſtudies, to find out new phraſes, and that which they conceiued with great labour they vtter with extreame difficultie, they ſtammer often, and commit many diſcords, if they continue long in diſcourſe; for the moſt part, their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue conſorteth not with their Exordium.

Sometimes I haue heard theſe batchellors hold talke ſo wilfully and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly, in matters of Philoſophie and Diuinitie, with ſuch groſſe errours and abſurdities, that any wiſe man would either haue deſpiſed them for malapert and contentious, or elſe haue regiſtred them in the predicament of fooles.</p>
                        <p>And without all queſtion, this manner of ſpeech, or wrangling, or let vs call it diſputation, cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from great ignorance and arrogancie: for no wiſe man will contend in ſuch matters as he knoweth not. Whereupon came that ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> Euery man ought to be credited in his Art: and that other common prouerbe; Let not the cobler paſſe his pantofle. For confirmation hereof, I will bring no better argument than euery mans common experience. There is no man (I thinke) but commonly he applieth himſelfe to one thing or other, this trade or that, ſome ſtudie or art: as for example, a Printer, or a Goldſmith; if another man ignorant of his art, ſhould come and diſpute with him,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21840:66"/> and condemne him, becauſe he vſeth ſuch and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, this or that manner of working; he would laugh, and account him ignorant, as one that ſpeaketh rather by chance than cunning, and hold him for more bold than wiſe: ſo queſtionleſſe let theſe men aſſure themſelues, that if they diſpute of that they know not, they muſt be accounted preſumptuous, although they would not. Neither for this I diſallow ſome good wits, to propound their difficulties which occurre in matters wherein they are not practiſed; as for Lawyers in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, Phyſitians in Law, and Diuines in Phyſicke, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſuch men as commonly are accounted learned in thoſe faculties; yet not to contend much, becauſe the further they paſſe forward, the harder it will be for them to wind out againe. This rule admitteth ſome exception; for I haue knowne Diuines very good Phyſitians, and Lawyers not altogether ignorant of Diuinitie, yea and Phyſitians practiſed in them both; in ſuch caſes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe of one profeſsion may excell thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but this I hold for very rare, becauſe, he that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth his wit to many ſciences, commonly cannot be excellent in any. Wherefore men that be vnlearned, but diſcreet, either will not moue any queſtions in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as paſſe beyond the ſphere of their capacities, or elſe in ſuch ſort, as they rather intend to learne than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21840:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> breake forth. Men that be vnwiſe, commonly ſpeake of friuolous &amp; baſe matters; vitious men of one or other ſort of vice; graue and wiſe men of ſerious &amp; profound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and if they deſcend to ſome lower ſubiect, either they paſſe it ouer very ſleightly, or therein touch ſome point ſo wittily, that <hi>ex vnguibus,</hi> you may know him a lion. Some men talke much of themſelues, and as it were glancing at their owne commendation, and by little and little inſinuating their owne praiſes: or if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, preſently you ſhall ſee them puft vp, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a vaine pleaſure and delight they haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of themſelues. But you will perhaps demaund of me by the way, What if a man ſhould commend me, or any thing appertaining vnto me, how ought I carry my ſelfe? If I accept the praiſe, I ſhall be accounted prowd; if I denie it, not to be ſo, I ſhall ſeeme to reprehend the praiſer, and condemn him for a liar or a flatterer. In ſuch a caſe, becauſe it occurreth daily, therefore good it were, to foreſee and prouide an anſwere preſently. As <hi>Alfonſus</hi> king of Arragon anſwered an Orator, who had recited a long panigericall Oration of his praiſes; the king ſaid<note place="margin">Panorm. lib. 1. de reb. geſt.

Or elſe a wiſe man may ſay, This praiſe I deſerue not, but your affection bettereth my actions: or, You by good nature and loue rather marke the little good I doe, than many defects therein committed: or, The ſpectacles of loue forceth you to cenſure all my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in good part.

                        <p>AS ſome are ſo ſecret, that they neuer will open any thing, almoſt, touching their own affaires; ſo others contrarily are ſo ſimple and blabbiſh, that they diſcouer many of their conceits and matters, eſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues, to any man, almoſt at the firſt meeting.

Therefore, if thou be wiſe, truſt no man with that thou wouldeſt not haue publickely knowne, except he be a tried friend by long experience, yea, although he be thy friend: but vitious (if amongſt vitious perſons there may be true friendſhip) aſſure thy ſelfe, that by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him thy mind, thou haſt halfe reuealed publickly thine owne ſecret: for ſuch perſons vſually (if they bee young men, women, or of a very ill behauiour) be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, blabbiſh, and moſt indiſcreet in their ſpeeches: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, their loue being grounded in proper intereſt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and gaine, when theſe by chaunce or diſpleaſure ſhall faile, then perſuade thy ſelfe, that all they know ſhall be reuealed, becauſe ſuch imprudent perſons ſuppoſe that friendſhip once being diſſolued, they are not bound any more, either to keepe ſecret, or conſerue thy credit, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21840:69"/> ſo with one breath they blow all away. Wherfore I take it for a generall rule, that a man ſhold reſerue his ſecrets of importance, either to himſelfe; or not to manifeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only to honeſt &amp; vertuous friends, leaſt it befall vnto him as happened to three ſtudents in a colledge where I liued ſome yeers.

After a little while, he which wrote the letter, came to the Colledge, and hearing how the perſon which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in that extreame manner, had gotten intelligence of the letter, (becauſe he was one of ſome authoritie) he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him which firſt had reuealed the matter; who ſwore, that he neuer had vttered any ſuch words, but indeed that the other had by a ſtratageme gotten knowledge of the letter: then the perſon which wrote the letter called him that ſo wililie had found it foorth, and (although he had

Who that knew theſe men, would ſcarcely haue beleeued, that any ſuch errours could by them haue bene committed; but by this experience (becauſe I was priuie to all their dealings) I got occaſion, to ſuſpect falſhood in fellowſhip, to trie ere I truſted; and finally, thought none more ſecret than a man to himſelfe: for many hearts muſt haue many breathings; and few can conceale from their friends any ſecret, when their friends reueale ſome ſecrets vnto them: and for that almoſt there liueth none ſo barren of friendſhip, but hee hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>OTher men more maliciouſly pretend friendſhip, and vſe ſtrange dealing, either to make friends, or to breed diſſention: ſome I haue found of ſuch an humour, that if they ſee two conuerſe familiarly together and one to affect much another, they, vnder colour of amitie, will goe ſecretly and reueale to the one of them, what they know, or heare, or that the other perſon his friend, ſecretly ſpoke or wrought to his diſcredit; yea, diuers things they will relate, by their owne malice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, as by his friend diſcouered: yet this they will not deliuer, but vnder an oath, that he ſhould not detect them to the other, whereby he of ſimplicitie often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21840:70"/> all he knew of his friend, becauſe he beleeued his friend in very deed had betrayed him; whereas, for the moſt part, all was but a bait, forged to catch the ſeely ſimple ſoule. Preſently after, they conuent the other, whom in ſecret they tell all they had fiſhed out of his friend, in his diſpraiſe, and ſo learne what they can of the other, charging him withall, in no caſe to manifeſt that he heard to the other. This ſtratageme I know many politique ſuperiors to haue frequented, and ſome perſons of great pollicie, but of moſt ſmall conſcience. Becauſe this wicked inuention proceedeth from a moſt malicious vncharitable, and enuious mind, which hateth the peace and concord of friends; it argueth alſo, a craftie poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique wit, apt to ſift out other mens actions: for he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the poore man into an inextricable labyrinth: for forcing him to ſweare, he cannot examine whether his friend ſpoke ſo ill of him, or no; leſt by the notice thereof he ſhould incur the crime of periurie: neither can he tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat in his mind, that his friend ſhould ſo notoriouſly abuſe him: wherefore he reſolueth himſelfe, either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to breake friendſhip, or at leaſt, not to vſe his friend ſo familiarly as before.</p>

                        <p>PLay pregnantly prooueth paſsions: for pride, chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and couetouſneſſe, commonly wait vpon great gamſters. Some, when they leeſe, are ſo inflamed with ire and choller, that you would take them rather for bedlams than reaſonable creatures; they ſweare, curſe, and crie; euery word ſpoken againſt them, ſufficeth to picke a quarrell, or deſerueth (in their iudgements) a buffet. This inordinat behauiour argueth, firſt blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and folly; for if you aske them with whom they are offended, they themſelues cannot ſhew you: not with themſelues, for that were madneſſe; with the dice? and that were as great follie; with fortune? but that is nothing: therefore wee muſt conclude, that they (in ſuch fits) are fooles, and brawle with the very aire.</p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:21840:72"/>
                        <p>Beſides, theſe chafing players, play not for recreation, but for gaine; they vſe company, more for couetouſneſſe than for honeſty; becauſe, they would not fret ſo much at their looſing, if they affected not too much the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and in very deed they abuſe the nature of play, the which was giuen as a medicine to recreat mens afflicted minds: but theſe, prepoſterouſly rather afflict the mind, &amp; make it a poiſon: for they are ſo anxious in themſelues, and many feare ſo much to leeſe, that as ſoone as a little ſumme is drawne from them, you could hardely diſcerne whether the heart were more vexed with griefe, or the tongue defiled with oathes. I would truely that in euery common-weale princes ſhould puniſh all perſons, that play greater games than their abilitie doth affoord; for I take ſuch ſorts of exerciſes to be moſt pernicious, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons, to the ſtate; and I thinke the puniſhment mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for them, ſhould be, that it were lawfull to beg them for Wardes, and giue them tutors, becauſe they lacke diſcretion to vſe their money. Rarely you find great play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that carry not proud minds, who if they win, they vaunt of gaine, if they leeſe, they doe brag of loſſe: as a Spaniard in a brauado, thought he deſerued great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, becauſe hee was able one night to leeſe ten thouſand crownes at dice.</p>
                        <p>Others, in play ſhew likewiſe their paſsions, albeit they exceed not much the lawfull quantity requiſit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, yet they carry a ſecret pride, &amp; vehement deſire to win, becauſe they would not be inferior to others, euen ſo much as in play: wherefore, if any caſt come croſſe vnto them, they will chafe as much for a penny, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man for a pound. Theſe men queſtionleſſe haue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21840:72"/> ſome little ſhrubs of pride and vanitie: for although the moſt pleaſure in play conſiſteth in the victorie; yet to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it too much, to wrangle, to chafe, to fret therefore, argueth an vnmortified affection, the which wiſe men ought to ouercome, becauſe ſuch paſsions are in very deed childiſh, and vndecent for graue perſons.</p>
                        <p>Some men wholly conſecrat themſelues to play, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhall haue them at dice, cards, bowles, or ſome ſuch game. Theſe, as vnprofitable members, deſerue to be cut from the bodie of euery good commonweale; for what wiſe man would tollerat a ſeruant in his houſe, which did nothing but eat, drinke, and play? They weigh little their ſoules, for if they did, doubtleſſe they would ſpend better their time, becauſe it ſeemeth that they were rather created to play than to labour, addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more to the pleaſures of the bodie, than to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the ſoule, and moſt like bruit beaſts follow the inordinat appetite of ſence, more than the right rule of reaſon. Theſe actions proceed from a ſoule altogether depriued of vertue, and repleniſhed with vice, which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be named brutiſh than reaſonable.</p>
                        <p>By this it appeareth, that thoſe that are addicted much to play, are ſenſuall, chafers in play are couetous, great gameſters are fooliſh: the firſt getteth baſe pleaſure, the ſecond gaineth great vexation, the laſt winneth pouertie: all ſeeme to loue themſelues; but doubtleſſe, all hate their ſoules: I ſay, they ſeeme to loue their bodies, but indeed they are moſt cruell enemies, for they are butchers which feed their calues for ſlaughter; they are fiſhers, who caſt a golden hooke with a little alluring bait, to catch the fiſhes for the frying pan; they cheriſh their bodies with a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21840:73"/> moment of pleaſure, after to be puniſhed with an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of paine. To play too earneſtly doth argue pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, choller, or follie: to play too careleſly, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, &amp; carieth ſome ſparke of contempt: not to play at all, proceedeth either from extreame holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, grauitie, hypocriſie, or inſenſibilitie. Therefore in game vſe the golden meane, play not too much, nor too ſeriouſly, nor to great game; take it as medicines, vſe ſome attention, play for a trifle.</p>

Some men, when they haue done any thing worthy of praiſe, they either like hennes goe cackling in regard of their new layd egge, that is, blazing their owne works; or indeuour by ſecret inſinuation, or groſſe induſtrie, that others ſhould commend them: as the Italian Poet did, who hauing made an Epigram which much pleaſed his fancy, ſhewed it to ſome of his friends, prayſing it about the Skies: they preſently demaunded, who was the Author? then he for very ſhame of pride, would not tell them that it was his,

This newfangleneſſe proceedeth from an inconſtant mind, a proud heart, and an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> had alwayes in hatred, rich and gorgeous garments, becauſe he ſayd they were<note place="margin">Sueton.</note> banners blaſing our pride, and neaſts to breed leachery.

                        <head>VIII. Diſcouerie of Paſsions in Writing.</head>
                        <p>WHo of purpoſe writeth obſcurely, peruetteth the naturall communication of men; becauſe we write to declare our minds, and he that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth obſcurity, ſeemeth, not to be willing that men ſhould conceiue his meaning. The holy Scriptures I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes except, which for many cauſes admit ſome obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. But for men, in their writing to follow ſuch a phraſe as hardly you can vnderſtand what they ſay, cannot but proceed either from confuſed vnderſtanding, becauſe a cleere conceit breedeth perſpicuous deliuerie, or affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learning, which ſpringeth from pride; for I haue knowne moſt excellent men endeuour to ſpeake and write the greateſt myſteries of our faith, in ſuch plaine maner, that very deepe diuinitie ſeemed very eaſie. And I truely am of opinion, that he is the greateſt Diuine, and moſt profitable to the common-weale, which can make his learning to be beſt conceiued.</p>
                        <p>To vſe many Metaphors, Poetical phraſes in proſe, or incke-pot tearmes, ſmelleth of affectation, and argueth a proud childiſh wit. To be peremptorie and ſingular in opinions, to cenſure ill, or condemne raſhly, without rendring ſome ſound and ſtrong reaſon, for the moſt part proceedeth from ſingular ſelfe loue, and a defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement.</p>
                        <p>Some will condemne others for writing, becauſe they thinke there bee Bookes written more than ſufficient: This cenſure commeth, either from a ſluggiſh mind, or enuious, to ſee others good endeuours commended; or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21840:80"/> elſe from groſſe ignorance, becauſe they neither know the nature of mens wits, nor the limits of humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for if we ſee the art of ſayling with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, the exerciſe of Artillerie, the manner of Printing, of late yeeres inuented, augmented, and perfitted; Why may not diuers Sciences already inuented, be increaſed with new conceits, amplified with better Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, explaned in a more perſpicuous manner, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a more ordinat method?</p>
                        <p>Contrary to theſe be certaine itching ſpirits, who put euery toy in print, they prize their owne workes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and cenſure others iniuriouſly: theſe may well be compared to certaine wild vines, which bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grapes, but neuer mature them: ſome doe it for ſame, and ſome for gaine, and both without diſcretion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne credit. Therefore great wiſedome it were, to write ſomething diſcreetly, that mens labours may, not onely profit themſelues, but alſo be deriued to others: for what doe we account good in it ſelfe, if it bee not communicatiue of goodneſſe, to others? <hi>Bonum eſt ſui diffuſinum.</hi> Yet would I haue men not to blab out their conceits without meditation, or good digeſtion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if in all actions it concerneth greatly a mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, to effectuat them with deliberation and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſo, much more in writing, which no man haſteth, being diſtilled drop by drop from the pen, and of it ſelfe permanent, not as words communicatiue to ſome few preſent auditors, but blazed to the world, and ſent to all poſteritie.</p>
                        <p>Some men, in writing, flow with phraſes, but are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in ſubſtance of matter, and ſuch are neither wittie nor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21840:80"/> wiſe: others haue good conceits, but deliuered after an affected manner; they put a little liquor into too great a veſſell. Others are ſo conciſe, that you need a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to vnderſtand them; the former be not without all follie, and the latter lacke not ſome pride: yet thoſe are more commendable than theſe, for thoſe onely are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thorow their prolixitie, but theſe are moleſtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they require too great attention, and make a man often ſpend many ſpirits, to win a ſlender knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Many write confuſedly, without method and order, and ſuch comprehend not their matter: others are too preciſe in diuiſions, in ſuch ſort, that ere you come to the laſt part, you haue forgotten the firſt members: and this defect I find in many poſtils of ſcriptures. Good diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons breed perſpicuitie: but a multitude engendreth obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and beſt I hold it ſo to diſtinguiſh, that diſtinctions may rather be noted in matter than in words.</p>
                        <p>With this I thinke good to conclude the diſcouery of Paſsions in humane actions, omitting much more that might bee ſaid in this matter; as what paſsions may bee diſcouered in laughing, in diſputing, in croſsing, in nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating, and ſuch like externall operations: and eſpecially two diſcourſes I haue omitted, or rather not printed though penned; the one is a diſcouerie of paſsions in cenſuring bookes, a matter not vnneceſſarie for this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall age, wherein euery mans labours are araigned at the tribunall ſeat of euery pedanticall cenſurious <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchs</hi> vnderſtanding. The other, is diſcouerie of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in taking Tabacco. The former treatiſe was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept from me, and therefore not in my power to print: the latter, vpon ſome good conſiderations was for a time
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21840:81"/> ſuſpended: but leſt my labour ſhould be too long, and the Diſcourſe too tedious, I will leaue theſe, and many more, to the Readers wittie obſeruation and deliberat iudgement.</p>

But I cannot herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with <hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe I thinke there is no man that euer perceiued in himſelfe ſo vehement a deſire of any thing he loued, as ſadneſſe and griefe when he was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with that he hated. In feare alſo who perceiueth

And he prooueth out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that this effect may be naturall. Neither <hi>Caietanes</hi> ſhift vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> ſerueth any thing to the purpoſe, that wee perceiue better our deſires of the ſoule, without any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall alteration of the body, than either loue, pleaſure, or hatred: for this comment ſpoyleth the text, becauſe hardly we conceiue any actions of the ſoule, but by theſe corporall alterations, the which induce vs to name them according to <hi>Thomas</hi> his meaning: neither is it true that we prooue by experience, without the motions of the body more ſenſibly concupiſcence, than ioy or ſadneſſe: and this aſſumption was admitted of <hi>Caietane,</hi> without any probation. Wherefore I thinke we may beſt ſay, that of all paſsions wee prooue paine, griefe, ſadneſſe, pleaſure, feare, and delectation are moſt notoriouſly knowne: yet becauſe theſe vehement paſsions doe not affect vs ſo commonly, but at certaine times, and deſires of thoſe things we loue, continue the longeſt, and fall foorth ofteneſt; therefore men called our ſenſitiue appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite <hi>Concupiſcibilis,</hi> coueting. Firſt of all then, ſadneſſe moſt manifeſtly is knowne to vs, becauſe wee ſuffer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and feele moſt ſenſible paine; then pleaſure, then feare: the other are not ſo open, but ſometimes they may exceed, and ſo more ſhew themſelues, as ire, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>2 DIuines and Philoſophers commonly affirme, that all other paſsions acknowledge loue to be their fountaine, root, and mother; the reaſon I take to be for that al paſsions, either proſecut ſome good, or flie ſome euill: thoſe which flie euill, as hatred, feare, ſadneſſe, preſuppoſe the loue of ſome good, the which that euill depriueth, as for example; who hateth death, but he which loueth life? who feareth aduerſity, but he that loueth proſperitie? who is penſiue in his ſickeneſſe, but hee that loueth health? Loue then goeth before all thoſe paſsions which eſchew euil. Amongſt them which proſecute good, loue likewiſe proceedeth, for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our minds are not vnlike the motions of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For as things naturally mooued, haue an appetite or naturall inclination to the place whereunto they are mooued, mooue, and reſt therein; as the water which runneth ſo faſt downe the mountaines, hath an inſtinct of Nature to be vnited with the Sea, for which cauſe we ſee brookes and flouds runne with ſuch a maine force to attaine thereunto, when they come to the Sea; preſently they ioyne in friendſhip, and liue in concord, ioyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as louing friends: euen ſo, we ſee in beaſtes, the horſe loueth water when hee is thirſtie, and therefore by deſire hee ſeeketh out ſome riuer or fountaine; when he hath found it, he drinketh, pleaſeth himſelf therewith, and ſo reſteth contented. This ordinarie courſe keepe paſsions: but ſometimes this ſubordination is changed, for if a man bee wounded, vpon a ſodaine, the preſent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21840:82"/> paſsion of griefe and ire inuade him: and ſo <hi>per accidens,</hi> in many other caſes, the foreſaid order may be broken.</p>

                        <hi>Anne</hi> the daughter. And the reaſon of this enlarged and extenſiue affection in paſsions, I thinke proceedeth from the very heart and nature of euery paſsion: For when we loue God, our parents, or friends, we are well pleaſed and contented with all thoſe treaſures of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21840:86"/> honeſtie, wealth and all other perfections they haue, and wiſh them ſuch as beſeeme them, which they want; and this we deſire to ſee performed, and reioyce when it is accompliſhed: and therefore ſince that a man hath many good things of nature, as children, wife, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, &amp;c. and many additions by fortune, as ſeruants, horſes, poſſeſsions, &amp;c. and many priſed ornaments, as credit, glorie, fame, images, ſtatues, &amp;c. and diuers other things which haue reference and relation vnto him as their maſter, lord, and owner: and therefore he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth intirely his friend, loueth all that belongeth vnto his friend, and valueth them at that rate it deſerueth and his friend priſeth them. In hatred and enuie contratiwiſe, euery one deteſteth not onely the perſon, but alſo all that appertaineth vnto him, for the contrarie reaſon; neither can he abide to ſee any thing proſper which concerneth him. Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> offering his prayer to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſteth him to defend his innocencie and puniſh his enemie: and not onely his perſon, but alſo wiſheth his children ſhould become orphanes, <hi>Fiant filij eius orpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi>

I haue knowne ſome men ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionat, that it was a moſt bitter corroſiue vnto their hearts to ſee the children of their enemies but well apparelled: and it is held for a good point in policie and apt to moue compaſsion, when the prince is offended with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that hee appeare not before him in gorgious but mourning attire: and ſo Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> recounteth that diuers noble women depoſed all their pompe and<note place="margin">Chriſoſt. hom. ad populi.</note> pride, and after a moſt meane manner and with poore apparell preſented themſelues before the iudges to ſue for their husbands in that lamentable commotion at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch: and as much the ſcriptures inſinuat, that a man ſhould doe to God, as <hi>Baruch</hi> teſtifieth: <hi>Anima quae triſtis</hi>

His meaning is, the contrite heart, and humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and abiect conceit a ſinner hath of himſelfe, cauſed by true repentance, exalt Gods greatneſſe and extoll his maieſtie, the which his mortall enemies ſo greeue to haue offended.</p>
                     <p>Out of this diſcourſe we may collect ſome practicall points very profitable, and know a reaſon how men commonly carrie themſelues towards appaſsionat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, for that we ſay ſight ſtirreth vp paſsions, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21840:87"/> not onely the perſons we loue, but alſo whatſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſeth any thing of them. Therefore generally among friends which be abſent and out of ſight, affections are colder and rarer: for although true friends haue alwayes a ſecret cabinet in their memories to talke in their minds with them whom they loue, although abſent; yet except the memorie be reuiued by ſome externall obiect, obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entreth, thoughts are more remiſſe, &amp; friendſhip fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: Wherefore, meſſages, letters, tokens, friends, kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, and ſuch things as concerne vs, are to bee ſent to our friends to renouat and reuiue our former amitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we would not exaſperat our enemies, it were expedient not onely we our ſelues, but alſo all theſe things which any way belong vs, appeare not in their ſights: yea, and that is more, we muſt take heed as much as in vs lieth, that they vnderſtand not any proſperitie or good befallen vnto vs: becauſe in all theſe ſights ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is ſtirred vp and reuiued anew, which lay ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before vnder the embers of forgetfulneſſe: and ſo with ſilence perhaps enmitie of it ſelfe will conſume and pine away.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to perſuade any matter we intend, or to ſtirre vp any paſsion in a multitude, if we can aptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our opinion or intention with any viſible obiect, no doubt but the perſuaſion would bee more forcible, and the paſsion more potent. <hi>Cato</hi> was determined to ſtrike the Senat and Romanes, with feare of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian forces; &amp; leaſt they ſhould obiect againſt him, that Carthage was farre from them, and therefore not ſo dangerous, he preſently ſhewed them greene figges, at that inſtant brought from Carthage; &amp; ſo they all concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                     <p>The Macedonians being once ouercome in battel by their adiacent enemies, thought the onely remedie that remained to inanimate their ſouldiours to battell, was to carrie their yong king <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt in his cradle to the field, thereby ſtirring vp the zeale of faithfull ſubiects to defend their innocent prince: and this little wherſtone ſo ſharpned their ſwords, that indeed they woon the battel.</p>
                     <p>The people of Tangia in America in their warres ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alwayes in their campe the corpes and bones of their auntient famous warriers, thereby intending to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their ſouldiours with the worthie memorie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their predeceſſours. Agria a citie in Hungaria, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſieged the yeere 1562 by <hi>Mahomet Baſſa</hi> with an armie of 60000 Turkes, and battered with 50 cannons; in the citie were onely 2000 Hungarians, who with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible valour had repelled thirteene moſt terrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults: and albeit they were moſt valiant, yet to encreaſe their valour, they (expecting another freſh aſſault)
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21840:88"/> ſware themſelues, that vpon perill of death no man ſhould talke or ſpeake of peace, or yeelding, nor giue other anſwere to theſe vnſatiable ſuckers of Chriſtian blood, but with cannons, muskets, and caliuers: and in caſe the ſiege endured longer than their victuals laſted, then rather to die of hunger, than ſubmit themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Turkiſh ſlauerie. And at laſt when the Baſſa had offered them diuers faire and fauourable conditions, if they would yeeld, they with a viſible ſigne to moue him to diſpaire of his intent, hanged ouer the wall a coffin couered with blacke betwixt two ſpeares, thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto him, that in that citie they would be buried: and ſo preuailed.</p>
                     <p>Among the Iewes the arke of God as a viſible ſigne was borne by the Leuits in the battell, as with a preſent obiect to deliuer them from all feare of enemies, thereby conceiuing the infallible aſsiſtauce and protection of God ouer them, whoſe cauſe they handled and defended. I haue ſeene ſome preachers bring a dead mans ſcull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pulpit, therewith the better to moue their auditors to contemne the transſitorie pleaſures of this world, to beat into them a terrour of death, to the intent that for the reſt of their dayes, they might lead a better life.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all it ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered, that the preſence of any viſible obiect, moueth much more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently. the paſsion, than the imagination or conceit thereof in the abſence: for the imagination in abſence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth the pleaſure as farre off and not prepared; but the thing being preſent, nothing ſeemeth to want but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. And therfore we ſee beaſts in the preſence of the ſenſual obiects ſcarce poſsibly to be with held from them.</p>

                        <hi>How Paſsions are mooued with muſicke and inſtrumeuts.</hi> §. 2.</head>
                     <p>HOw muſicke ſongs and ſounds ſtirre vp paſsions, we may diſcouer in little ſucklings, who with their nurſes ſongs are brought to reſt; the mules with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out belles will ſcarcely trauell; the carman with whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cauſeth his ſturdie iades to walke more merily. The Arcadian ſignorie conſidering that in regard of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their countrey, the inhabitants for moſt part were barbarous, ſauage, and wild; to molifie more their minds, &amp; to render them more mild, gentle, &amp; humane, iudged no means more effectuall than to introduct muſicke among them: For in very deed a certaine kind of tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſymphonie maketh men effeminat and delicat. The Spaniards play their Zarabanda vpon the Gittern, which moueth them (as I heare reported) to daunce, and doe worſe. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> once chaunced to fall into the<note place="margin">Baſil. hom. de legen lib. Gen. tilium.</note> company of drunkards, where a muſitian ruled their laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious banket: he preſently commanded him to change his harmonie and ſing a Dorion, and ſo with this maner of melodie brought them to ſobrietie, and caſting their garlands from their heads were aſhamed of all they had done. <hi>Saul</hi> being poſſeſſed or at leaſt much vexed with<note place="margin">1. Reg. 16.</note> the deuil, <hi>Dauid</hi> played vpon his Citheran, and hee was comforted and the euill ſpirit departed.</p>
                     <p>The deuill being a ſpirit, cannot be expelled from a bodie naturally by the vertue of muſicke, but as we may conceiue and inferre out of the ſcriptures, either <hi>Saul</hi> was really poſſeſſed by the deuill, and then not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21840:89"/> forces of <hi>Dauids</hi> ſongs and ſounds, but the aſsiſtance of God and his help expelled the deuill, at what time <hi>Dauid</hi> ſung his ſacred hymnes. Or the deuill was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Saul,</hi> but onely moleſted him with the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of ſome melancholy humour, as the falling ſickneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſome other ſort of melancholy madneſſe: and then as this peruerſe malignant humour cauſeth feares, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſuch like melancholy paſsions; ſo muſicke cauſeth mirth, ioy, and delight, the which abate, expell, and quite deſtroy their contrary affections, and withall, rectifie the blood and ſpirits, and conſequently diſgeſt melancholy, and bring the body into a good temper. Whether of theſe two was in <hi>Saul,</hi> Diuines doubt, and Phyſitians are not able to reſolue. Reaſons may bee brought for both parts; ſome Diuines attribute it to God, ſome Phyſitians aſcribe the cure to the naturall vertue of muſicke. The reaſon for the Phyſitians, is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the text; for it ſeemeth that the diſeaſe or wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that poſſeſſed <hi>Saul</hi> was a thing vſuall in the countrey, becauſe his ſeruants councelled him to procure a muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, to the intent that when his maladie moleſted him, the muſicke might comfort him. It neuer was vſuall in any countrey, nor in all the ſcripture practiſed to caſt out deuils by the playing vpon inſtruments: therefore it was a melancholie humour, by the deuill introducted, and by muſicke cauſing mirth expelled.</p>
                     <p>The Diuines haue a more ſolid argument for their opinion, becauſe the ſcriptures ought to be vnderſtood in their proper ſence as the words ſound, when no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie neceſſarily thereupon enſueth, as in this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is euident; for, aſcribing it to God what abſurditie can
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21840:89"/> follow? now the ſcripture euermore calleth this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſpirit, and the wicked ſpirit, verſ. 14. <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Domini rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Againe I would gladly know when theſe Phyſitians euer ſee with a fit of mirth either theſe melancholy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes notoriouſly remitted, or when the paroxime was vpon them quite taken away, let it bee either Lycan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropia, that is, a woolfiſh madneſſe; or Epilepſia the falling ſickneſſe? if they could ſhew me ſuch a minſtrell, I doubt not but in ſhort time he would be able to buy all the Phyſitians that dwell within an hundred miles of him. For the ſcripture ſaith expreſly, <hi>Dauid tollebat &amp; percutiebat manu ſua &amp; refocillabatur Saul &amp; leuius habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, recedebat enim ab eo ſpiritus malus,</hi> If the deuill perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally had not afflicted him, the humour had ceaſed from moleſtation but not departed away: and the ſcripture yeeldeth a reaſon (as appeareth by the word <hi>enim</hi>) why he was comforted, becauſe the deuill was gone away.</p>
                     <p>The argument which I obiected in fauour of the Phyſitians may bee anſwered two wayes: firſt, that the ſeruants of <hi>Saul</hi> no otherwiſe intended to cure his diſeaſe by muſicke, than commonly in the maladies or vexation of great perſonages, their friends procure muſick to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them; whence from ſoeuer the maladies proceed, they neither know, nor generally regard. Secondly, it might be that God extraordinarily was accuſtomed to<note place="margin">4. Reg. 3.</note> worke in thoſe dayes wonders by the means of muſicke,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21840:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> as afterwards wee read of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> who deſiring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetiſe, called for a muſitian, at whoſe ſong, the ſpirit of God fell vpon him. And it is a thing vſuall with God, to worke miraculous effects by creatures which haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no vertue at all to worke ſuch an effect, or onely a weake reſemblance. What naturall vertue had the dirt<note place="margin">Ioh. 9. Iud. 16.</note> and ſpit of Chriſt, to cure the blind borne begger? What vertue had <hi>Samſons</hi> haires, to afford him ſuch ſtrength and forces? What naturall vertue lurked in the aſſes<note place="margin">Iud. 16.</note> iaw, to yeeld him water vnto ſatietie?

The water of Iordan had vertue to waſh, but<note place="margin">4. Reg. 5. 4.

So I ſay, muſicke naturally expelleth melancholie; and God either miraculouſly by <hi>Dauids</hi> muſicke, or at his muſicke deliuered <hi>Saul</hi> from the deuill, who afflicted him in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy manner: For, that muſicke cauſeth mirth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the dayly experience which prooueth it, we haue Gods word to confirme it, <hi>Vinum &amp; muſica laetiſicant</hi>

                     <p>Some men wonder (and not without reaſon) how it commeth to paſſe, that out of the ſame mouth ſhould iſſue a cold wind to coole the hot pottage, and a hot
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21840:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> breath to warme the cold hands. But muſicke is much more miraculous, for it moueth a man to mirth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and affecteth him with ſorow and ſadneſſe; it inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to deuotion, and inticeth to diſſolution: it ſtirreth vp ſouldiers to warre, and allureth citizens to peace. Take away muſicke from marriages, and halfe the mirth<note place="margin">Muſick cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mirth.</note> is mard: depriue great bankets of muſicke, and the feaſt is not intire: there is but ſorrie dauncing, where muſicke is wanting: diſpoile tradesmen and labourers of naturall muſicke, and take from them a ſoueraigne preſeruatiue<note place="margin">Muſicke cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> from paine. Muſicke therefore mooueth men to mirth and abateth the heauie humour of melancholie. But how cauſeth muſicke ſorow and ſadneſſe? What are <hi>Hieremies</hi> lamentable threens, but a ſorowfull ſong brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed ouer the citie of Hieruſalem? What are <hi>Dauids</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall Pſalmes, but monefull anthemes inclining the ſoule to ſorow for ſinne? What are funebriall accents, but ruthful lamentations for our friends eclipſed? What elſe are thoſe dolefull tunes which iſſue from langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing louers, but offſprings of penſiue furies, and origens of more vehement melancholie fits? All poeticall fained fables, or ſophiſticated hiſtories, are loaden with theſe wailing verſes and ſwanlike, or rather ſwinelike voices, occaſioned by mournfull deſpaire, and feeding the ſame.

                     <p>But to knit vp this diſcourſe, there remaineth a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be anſwered, as difficult as any whatſoeuer in all naturall or morall philoſophie, <hi>viz.</hi> How muſicke ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp theſe paſsions, and moueth ſo mightily theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? What hath the ſhaking or artificiall criſpling of the aire (which is in effect the ſubſtance of muſicke) to doe with rouſing vp choler, afflicting with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, iubilating the heart with pleaſure, eleuating the ſoule with deuotion, alluring to luſt, inducing to peace, exciting to compaſsion, inuiting to magnanimitie? It is not ſo great a meruaile, that meat, drinke, exerciſe, and aire ſet paſsions aloft, for theſe are diuers waies qualified, and conſequently apt to ſtirre vp humors; but what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie carie ſimple ſingle ſounds and voices, to enable them to worke ſuch wonders?</p>
                     <p>I had rather in this point read ſome learned diſcourſe, than deliuer mine opinion: neuertheleſſe, in ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe difficultie, he that ſpeaketh moſt apparently and probably, ſaith the beſt: and therefore I will ſet downe thoſe formes or manners of motion which occurre to my mind and ſeeme likelieſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is a certaine ſympathie, correſpondence, or proportion betwixt our ſoules and muſick: and no other cauſe can be yeelded. Who can giue any other reaſon, why the loadſtone draweth yron, but a ſympathie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21840:93"/> Why the Needle, toucht but with ſuch a ſtone, ſhould neuer leaue looking towards the North Pole; who can render other reaſon, than ſympathie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If we make a ſuruey of all birds of the aire, fiſhes of the ſea, beaſts of the land, we ſhall find euery ſort affect a proper kind of food: a lyon will eat no hay, nor a bull beefe; a horſe eateth bread, and a leopard abhorreth it: a kite liueth vpon carrion, and a hen cannot endure it: if a man ſhould beat his braine to find out the reaſon, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be giuen, than ſympathie of nature. So we may ſay, that ſuch is the nature of our ſoules, as muſicke hath a certaine proportionat ſympathie with them: as our taſts haue with ſuch varieties of daintie cates, our ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch varietie of odours, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond manner of this miracle in nature, ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and aſcribe to Gods generall prouidence, who when theſe ſounds affect the eare, produceth a certaine ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all qualitie in the ſoule, the which ſtirreth vp one or other paſsion, according to the varietie of voices, or conſorts of inſtruments. Neither this is to be meruailed at, for the very ſame vpon neceſsitie we muſt put in the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which not being able to dart the formes of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which are materiall; into the vnderſtanding, which is ſpirituall, therefore where nature wanteth, Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſupplieth. So corporall muſicke being vnable to worke ſuch extraordinarie effects in our ſoules, God by his ordinarie naturall prouidence produceth them. The like we may ſay of the creation of our ſoules; for men being able to produce the bodie, but vnable to create the ſoule, man prepareth the matter, and God createth the forme: ſo in muſicke, men ſound and heare, God ſtriketh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21840:94"/> vpon, and ſtirreth vp the heart.</p>
                     <p>The third maner more ſenſible &amp; palpable is this, that the very ſound it ſelfe, which according to the beſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, is nothing elſe but a certaine artificiall ſhaking, criſpling, or tickling of the ayre (like as we ſee in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter criſpled, when it is calme, and a ſweet gale of wind ruffleth it a little; or when wee caſt a ſtone into a calme water, we may perceiue diuers warbling naturall circles) which paſſeth thorow the eares, and by them vnto the heart, and there beateth and tickleth it in ſuch ſort, as it is moued with ſemblable paſsions. For as the heart is moſt delicat and ſenſatiue, ſo it perceiueth the leaſt motions and impreſsions that may be: and it ſeemeth that muſicke in thoſe celles playeth with the vitall and animate ſpirits, the onely inſtruments and ſpurres of paſsions. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we perceiue by a little tickling of our ſides, or the ſoles of our feet, how we are mooued to laughter, yea and the very heart ſtrings ſeeme in ſome ſort to be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this almoſt ſenceleſſe motion. And in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, we may bring two apt coniectures: The firſt is, in our own hands or face, the which if we ſmooth, tickle, preſſe downe, nip, heat, or coole, wee perceiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts &amp; diuerſities of ſenſations, and feele our ſelues ſundry wayes affected: if ſuch varieties we find in a thicke skin, how much more in a tender heart, farre more apter to feele than any member elſe of our bodie. The ſecond coniecture is, the filing of iron, and ſcraping of trenchers, which many naturally (yea and almoſt all men before they be accuſtomed vnto them) abhorre to heare, not only becauſe they are vngratefull to the eare, but alſo for that the aire ſo carued, puniſheth and fretteth the heart.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:21840:94"/>
                     <p>The laſt and beſt manner I take to be, that as all other ſences haue an admirable multiplicitie of obiects which delight them, ſo hath the eare: and as it is impoſsible to expound the varietie of delights, or diſguſtes, which we perceiue by them, and receiue in them (for who can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the delights wee take in eating fiſh, fleſh, fruit, ſo many thouſand ſauces, and commixtions of ſpices with fiſh, fleſh, and fruit?) ſo in muſicke, diuers conſorts ſtirre vp in the heart, diuers ſorts of ioyes, and diuers ſorts of ſadneſſe or paine: the which as men are affected, may be diuerſly applied: Let a good and a Godly man heare muſicke, and hee will lift vp his heart to heauen: let a bad man heare the ſame, and hee will conuert it to luſt: Let a ſouldiour heare a trumpet or a drum, and his bloud will boile and bend to battell; let a clowne heare the ſame, and he will fall a dauncing; let the common people heare the like, and they wil fall a gazing, or laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many neuer regard them, eſpecially if they bee accuſtomed to heare them. So that in this, mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and diſpoſitions, by meanes of muſicke, may ſtir vp diuers paſsions, as in ſeeing we daily prooue the like. True it is, that one kind of muſicke may be more apt to one paſsion than another, as alſo one obiect of ſight is more proportionat to ſtirre vp loue, hatred, or pleaſure, or ſadneſſe, than another. Wherefore the naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a man, his cuſtome or exerciſe, his vertue or vice, for moſt part at theſe ſounds diuerſificate paſsions: for I cannot imagine, that if a man neuer had heard a trumpet or a drum in his life, that he would at the firſt hearing be mooued to warres. Much more might bee ſaid in this matter, and yet not all fully ſatisfie and content
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21840:95"/> a ſound iudgement, but what occurred vnto me in this queſtion I haue ſet downe, leauing the choiſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or ſenſure, to them that ſee more in it than I doe.</p>

Therefore if we intend to imprint a paſsion in another, it is requiſit firſt it be ſtamped in our hearts: for thorow our voices, eyes, and geſtures, the world will pierce and thorowly perceiue how we are affected. And for this cauſe the paſsion which is in our breſt muſt be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and origen of all externall actions; and as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall affection is more vehement, ſo the externall perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be more potent: for the paſsion in the perſuader ſeemeth to mee, to reſemble the wind a trumpeter blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in at one end of the trumpet, and in what manner it proceedeth from him, ſo it iſſueth forth at the other end, and commeth to our eares; euen ſo the paſsion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the heart, and is blowne about the bodie, face, eies, hands, voice, and ſo by geſtures paſſeth into our eyes, and by ſounds into our eares: and as it is qualified, ſo it worketh in vs. But I know ſome would vnderſtand the cauſe, why a good reaſon in the preacher or oratour will not ſuffice to perſuade the people, vnleſſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be affected with the like paſsion? I anſwere, that wiſe men are moſt moued with ſound reaſons, and leſſe with paſsions: contrariwiſe the common people or men not of deepe iudgement, are more perſuaded with paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſpeakers; the reaſon is, becauſe as we haue two ſences of diſcipline eſpecially, the eyes &amp; the eares: reaſon entreth the eates; the paſsion wherewith the oratour is affected paſſeth by the eyes, for in his face we diſcouer it, and in other geſtures: the eyes are more certaine meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and leſſe to be doubted of, for we many times ſuſpect
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21840:97"/> the reaſons leaſt they be friuolous, although we cannot anſwere them; but thoſe paſsions we ſee, nature imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them deeper in our hearts, and for moſt part they ſeeme ſo euident, as they admit no tergiuerſation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the euidence and certaintie of the paſsion, perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much more effectually the common people, than a ſuſpected reaſon: and the ſuſpition of ſophiſtication is much more encreaſed when wee ſee it not worke that effect in the teacher which he would ſtirre vp in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Againe, vſually men are more moued with deeds than words, reaſonable perſuations reſemble words, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall paſsions are compared to deeds. Furthermore the paſsion paſſeth not onely thorow the eyes, but alſo pierceth the eare, and thereby the heart; for a flexible and pliable voice, accommodated in manner correſpondent to the matter whereof a perſon intreateth, conueyeth the paſsion moſt aptly, pathetically, and almoſt harmonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and euery accent, exclamation, admiration, increpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, indignation, commiſeration, abhomination, exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, exultation, fitly (that is diſtinctly, at time and place, with geſture correſpondent, and flexibilitie of voice proportionat) deliuered, is either a flaſh of fire to incenſe a paſsion, or a baſon of water to quench a paſsion incenſed.</p>
                     <p>A man therefore furniſhed himſelfe with the paſsion or affection he wiſheth in his auditors, ſhewing it with voice and action, although his reaſons be not ſo potent, hath no doubt a moſt potent meane to perſuade what he liſt. Wherefore <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> as of all Oratours the prince for action, ſo he defined, that the principall part of<note place="margin">Cicero in Brut.</note> an Oration was action; the ſecond, the ſame; the third, no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21840:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> other than action. <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> otherwiſe called the father of eloquence, for lacke of a good voice neuer pleaded publickely. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, ſome were <hi>viri diſerti,</hi> that is, very eloquent, but for lack of action or rather vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>habiti ſunt infantes,</hi> they were accounted infants: and I haue ſeene ſome preachers very meane ſchollers, and in truth otherwiſe but ſillie men, yet for that they excelled in action, all the world followed them. For acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either a certaine viſible eloquence, or an eloquence of the bodie, or a comely grace in deliuering conceits, or an externall image of an internall mind, or a ſhaddow of affections, or three ſprings which flow from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, called <hi>vox, vultus, vita,</hi> voice, countenance, life, that is, the affection poureth forth it ſelfe by all meanes poſsible, to diſcouer vnto the preſent beholders and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, how the actor is affected, and what affection ſuch a caſe and cauſe requireth in them: by mouth he telleth his mind; in countenance he ſpeaketh with a ſilent voice to the eyes; with all the vniuerſall life and bodie he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſay, Thus we moue, becauſe by the paſsion thus we are mooued, and as it hath wrought in vs ſo it ought to worke in you. Action then vniuerſally is a naturall or artificiall moderation, qualification, modification, or compoſition of the voice, countenance, and geſture of bodie proceeding from ſome paſsion, and apt to ſtirre vp the like: for it ſeemeth, that the ſoule playeth vpon theſe three parts, as a muſition vpon three ſtrings, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtriking ſo they ſound.</p>
                     <p>A number of precepts Oratours preſcribe about theſe three parts, and labour extreamly by art to perfit and accompliſh the rude indigeſted motions of nature: to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21840:98"/> them therefore I will leaue the minching of this matter in particularities, and onely ſet downe certaine genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, although art ſupplie the defects of nature, yet if a man haue not a good naturall habilitie, it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by art to come to any perfection for this manner of motion. The reaſon hereof is manifeſt, becauſe as in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, he that wanteth a tunable voice by nature, although he otherwiſe excell in the art of muſicke, yet it were leſſe paine to heare him ſay than ſing. And I haue knowne moſt exquiſit muſitians vnable to ſing aptly fiue notes: ſo in action, he that wanteth a good voice, a good nimble eye, a proportionat bodie, and other parts naturall, may ſpeak with reaſon, but neuer almoſt aptly for perſuaſion: indeed if the habilities of nature be not very vntoward, art may correct many defects of nature: as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had a little liſping at firſt, but by labour and diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. <hi>Iſocrates</hi> impediments were incorrigible, and therefore all his labour had been loſt, if he had emploied himſelfe to acting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he that will act well, muſt of neceſsitie ſtir vp firſt that affect in himſelfe, he intendeth to imprint in the hearts of his hearers; and the more vehement the paſsion is, the more excellent action is like to enſue. The reaſon is, for, as I ſaid aboue, the voice, eyes, and geſtures ſound without, as the heart ſtriketh within: and therfore the vehementer paſsion venteth forth, the liuelier action. Yet here muſt one or two cautions be conſidered: Firſt in ire and indignation, that the paſsion and action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh not of ſome priuat quarell or reuenge; for then it leeſeth all the force and grace of perſuaſion, becauſe the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21840:99"/> paſsion ſmelleth then of proper intereſt and vtilitie, and conſequently will be accounted inordinate and vitious. Secondly in feare and ſadneſſe, that they render not the actions vile and abiect: for then the paſsion will rather be occaſion or cauſe to ſmother and kill them, than to reuiue and animate them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, euery part of action ought to expreſſe the mind as grauely, as prudently, as ſolidly as may be: The reaſon is, becauſe he that publickely intendeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, muſt be eſteemed a wiſe, and a good man; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt make the auditors beleeue he erreth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ignorance, honeſtie muſt induce them to thinke hee will not lie: therefore all his actions ought to be prudent and graue: for if they be any way light or raſh, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he will be ſuſpected, either not to haue premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted maturely his matter, or not to regard what he ſaith, or not to be ſo ſetled in vertue and knowledge as ſuch an important matter requireth: for leuitie and raſhneſſe, at leaſt argue imprudence, inconſideration, immortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and precipitation, which all are capitall enemies to deepe conſulation, ſpecially in matters which concerne perſuaſion to vertue, or diſſuaſion from vice, exhortation to goodneſſe, or dehortation from ilneſſe. Wherefore in action all leuitie muſt be auoided: In voyce, that the words be not pronounced too faſt, nor any light or ſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous word enter in: In face, that the eye range not abroad vagabond like, nor be toſſed or turned too lightly; that the oratour make no faces, writhing of mouth, wrinkling of noſe, or too much ſhaking of head: Ingeſture, no tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with fingers, quickly wreſting of the bodie, light go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or much geſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ulation.</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:21840:99"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, he ought to endeuour, that euery part of action immitate as liuely as may be the nature of the paſsion: <hi>Sextus Philoſophus</hi> ſaid our bodie was <hi>imago ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> becauſe the maners of the ſoule followed the temper of the body, and therfore he that knew perfitly this, could not be ignorant of that: ſo the actions of the bodie ſhold be, in a perfit perſuader, an image of the paſsion in the mind. But how ſhal this be performed? Two general rules at this preſent occurre vnto my memorie, not very hard to be learned, but exceeding profitable to be practiſed.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that we looke vpon other men appaſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, how they demeane themſelues in paſsions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what and how they ſpeake in mirth, ſadneſſe, ire, feare, hope, &amp;c. what motions are ſtirring in the eyes, hands, bodie, &amp;c. And then leaue the exceſſe and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant leuitie or other defects, and keepe the manner corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with prudent mediocritie: and this the beſt may be marked in ſtage plaiers, who act excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly; for as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their exerciſe conſiſteth in imitation of others, ſo they that imitate beſt, act beſt. And in the ſubſtance of externall action for moſt part oratours and ſtageplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers agree: and onely they differ in this, that theſe act fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, thoſe really; theſe onely to delight, thoſe to ſtirre vp all ſorts of paſsions according to the exigencie of the matter; theſe intermingle much leuitie in their action to<note place="margin">Cicer lib. 3. de Orat.</note> make men laugh, thoſe vſe all grauitie, grace, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to perſuade: wherefore theſe are accounted redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, thoſe eſteemed prudent. But a diſcreet oratour may ſee in them what he may amend, and what he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. If there were an excellent preacher, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable not onely for doctrine, but alſo for action, hee
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21840:100"/> would ſerue as a glaſſe for euery oratour to behold the beautie or blots of his action.</p>
                     <p>Secondly loue, deſire, and ioy, require a plaine, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, ſoft, mild, gentle voice, and the like countenance: true it is that a diſcourſe ſermon or oration being wouen with various periods, and compounded of ſundry parts, generally cannot be ſaid to admit one onely ſort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation, action, or geſture: becauſe although wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for example to induce our auditors to loue God, to obey their prince, &amp;c. yet reaſon requireth, and art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, that our probations be often grounded vpon contraries, incommodities, diſgraces, puniſhments, and diuers inconueniences, which would enſue vpon the want and defect thereof: and therefore in euery part and period, the nature and qualitie of the affection, muſt rule and moderat the voyce and action.</p>
                     <p>Hatred and ire exact a vehement voice, and much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture a pronuntiation ſharpe, often falling with patheticall repetitions, iterated interrogations, prouing, confirming, and vrging reaſons: the manner of this action wee may beſt diſcouer in wittie women when they chide; becauſe although their exceſſe be vitious and not to be imitated, yet for that they let nature worke in her kind, their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faſhion will ſerue for a good meane to perceiue the externall manage of this paſsion. Their voyce is loud and ſharpe, and conſequently apt to cut, which is proper to ire and hatred, which wiſh ill, and intend reuenge: their geſtures are frequent, their faces inflamed, their eyes glowing, their reaſons hurry one in the necke of another, they with their fingers number the wrongs offered them, the harmes, iniuries, diſgraces, and what not, thought
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21840:100"/> ſayd, and done againſt them: if a prudent oratour could in this caſe batter their matter, circumciſe the weakneſſe of the reaſon, abate the exceſſe of their furie, certainely he might win a pretie forme for framing his action.</p>
                     <p>In ſadneſſe and commiſeration, a graue, doleful, plaine voyce is beſt, without much varietie either of eye, face, or hand, for the orator muſt ſhew himſelfe in ſoule and hart afflicted, oppreſſed, halfe dead; and therefore no more life ought to appeare without externall eyes and eares, than is neceſſary to deliuer the force of our reaſons, and the griefe of our minds: our proofes may bee vrged and proſecuted but alwayes with a pitifull weeping eye and a fainting lamentable tune: yet notwithſtanding, the voyce ſometimes ought to bee interrupted with wofull exclamations and ruthfull repetitions, with alas, woe is me, &amp;c. The eye alſo may be grauely eleuated vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or abiected to earth, but it muſt be done ſeldome and merueilous ſoberly.</p>
                     <p>As feare participateth of hatred and ſadneſſe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting an imminent euill, and ſorrowing leaſt it befall, and therefore requireth like voyce, countenance and action; ſo, becauſe little it would auaile to explaine the perill and daunger thereof, except we encouraged and ſtirred vp our hearers to attempt meanes, to proſecute labours, to enterpriſe difficulties, to encounter and reſiſt the euill: therefore according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> inſtruction, we muſt <hi>arguere, obſecrare, increpare,</hi> accuſe, requeſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. The example we may haue in the paſsion of a man, whoſe next neighbours houſe being ſet a fire, if he ſhould firſt of all diſcouer it and perceiue that verſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be verified in him.</p>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21840:103"/> loſt, for if we intend to perſuade them by profound reaſons, who either vnderſtand them not at all, or elſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuperficially, wee ſhall moone them to loath our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, and thereupon diſlike and perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our cauſe. Wherefore the paſsion mouer muſt looke narrowly to this point, &amp; imitate herein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe of prudent Phyſitians, who apply their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin to the ſame maladies with particular reſpect and conſideration of the patients temper, and ſo to a little child they will not giue the like purgation they would to a ſtrong man, nor to a delicate ladie, though affected with the ſame ague, which to a ſteelie ſtomackt boore of the countrie. In like maner, common people and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found doctors, are not to be perſuaded with the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for popular perſuaſions theſe prize not, &amp; deepe demonſtrations they pierce not. How to fail right vpon both, &amp; not decline to either extreame in perſuading the one part ſeuerally, requireth great prudence, and a ſound iudgement. Yet I thinke there may be found out a mean to propound &amp; deliuer deepe reaſons perſpicuouſly, and plauſible perſuaſions ſharply, ſo that the plainneſſe of the one will make them plauſible, and the acuteneſſe in the other will allay their flaſhneſſe and render them pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all it is to be noted, that not euery kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath force to ſtirre vp a paſsion, but an vrgent and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, either really or at leaſt in conceit: this wee prooue by experience, for common and ordinarie motiues moue vs not much to loue or like a thing: wherefore God to induce the Iſraelits to wiſh and deſire the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, deſcribed it as a countrey ſlowing with milke
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21840:103"/> and honie, &amp;c. and commonly euery one who would perſuade vs to loue or affect any thing, highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it; or contrariwiſe if a man would haue vs to hate and deteſt any thing, he endeuoureth as much as may be to make apparent the exceſſe of the euil or great damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it apporteth. Paſsions then muſt be moued with vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſons, reaſons vrging proceed from ſolid amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, amplifications are gathered from common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, common places fit for oratoricall perſuaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a part of Rhethoricke called Inuention. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were requiſit for an excellentſtir-paſsion to haue in a readineſſe all thoſe places which oratours aſsigne, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their arcinall or ſtorehouſe of perſuaſiue prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will briefly inſinuat them, ſuppoſing the reader and practiſer of this point a ſcholler both in Rethoricke and Philoſophie, for otherwiſe he ſhall receiue ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hereby, and onely I will deliuer him a ſhort plaine perſpicuous method how to call to memory theſe places; that by them, not onely in this matter of paſsions but in all diſcourſes, he may be enabled preſently almoſt in a glaunce to ſuruey, and comprehend all arguments and reaſons which occurre in his preſent affaire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a philoſopher cannot be ignorant of the foure firſt queſtions, which in the poſteriors he is taught to demaund of euery ſubiect. <hi>Quid nominis, Quid rei, Qualis ſit, Propter quid ſit.</hi> The name of the thing, the nature of the thing, the proprieties and accidents inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the thing, the finall and efficient cauſes of the thing.

                        <p>To theſe twentie places we may ad ten more, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon authoritie, largely declared by <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> in his twelue books <hi>De locis Theologius;</hi> but for that theſe concerne ſpecially diuines, and they may eaſily commit
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21840:107"/> them to memorie, therefore I will remit this labour to the related authour.</p>
                        <p>This ſhort abſtract of inuention I haue rather ſet downe to helpe the memorie, than to inſtruct the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for I am not ignorant, that this matter requireth an ample volume, and both Rhetoritians and Logitians ſpend much paines, and write large diſcourſes therupon. But for that I perceiued in my ſelfe, that a multitude of places, without a forme of method, engendered rather confuſion than furthered inuention, therefore I haue ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into heads: becauſe the nature of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is ſuch, that if it conceiue but an inckling of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, preſently by the force of diſcourſe, our vnderſtanding followeth it: and now hauing all places reduced to foure heads, he had a bad memory could not remember them, and a worſe wit which could not draw forth a number of arguments out of them. I cannot denie but pregnant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and eleuated iudgements in a moment, almoſt, pierce their matter, and behold before their eyes a number of ſound and ſubſtantiall reaſons, which enuiron the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion propoſed on euery ſide; but theſe be few and rare, others need more helpe: and yet euen theſe alſo may be greatly furthered, for the beſt places which conſort with common peoples capacities, are for moſt part out of learned mens bookes; as ſimilitudes, examples, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, remote accidents, and circumſtances, and therefore they had need of ſome ſhort remembrance, to pull their wits by the elbow, and will them not to diue too deepe, leaſt they, who by reaſon ſhould beſt vnderſtand their reaſons (I meane the meaner wits, who for moſt part are generall auditors) be depriued of that inſtruction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21840:108"/> the Oratour intendeth, and they expected. Thirdly, we muſt obſerue, that in amplifications (which are in effect nothing elſe but either exaggerations, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations of reaſons) diuers things are to be noted.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, in amplifications all conceits ſhould reliſh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine greatneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carie with them ſome ſort of exceſſe: if we praiſe, then the perſons and things praiſed muſt be commended for ſome admirable excellencie; if we exhort or diſſuade, then are to bee diſcouered a ſea of great goodneſſe, or a multitude of mightie euils.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the reaſons which we amplifie, require great perſpicuitie, and apertneſſe in deliuerie, becauſe the attention which otherwiſe ſhould be imployed about the affection, will wholy be conſumed or drawne to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for it is impoſsible to attend much at one time both to ſpeculation and affection. Furthermore our ſpeech being curſorie, and ſpecially framed for meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, will not be able to make any impreſsion in audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, except our reaſons be meruailous plaine &amp; euident.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, our reaſons ſhould be largely declared, and yet with ſharpe, and ſhort varietie interlaced: reſembling a volley of ſhot ſpeedily deliuered, but not without bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to batter downe the walles of wilfull affections.

And what was this beautie which ſo fed their appetites? it could not be certainely any other thing than the apt proportion and iuſt correſpondence of the parts and colours of viſible bodies, which firſt delighted the eye, and then contented the mind, not vnlike the harmony of proportionable voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and inſtruments, which ſeed the eare; and health which iſſueth from the iuſt proportion &amp; temper of the

                        <p>THe ground of every mans love of himſelfe, is the Identitie of a man with himſelfe, for the lover and beloved are all one and the ſame thing: becauſe love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe but a complacence or contentation in the goodnes or perfection one hath with a deſier of the accompliſhment thereof, conſequently as we ought both in grace and nature to preferre none before our ſelves in the affection of vertue and perfection, ſo we ſhould not love any above our ſelves. From the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of our ſelves and the love thereof, neceſſarily follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth a certaine love to all them who are vnited any way vnto vs, and the ſtricter this vnion is, the ſtricter affection it engendreth, and for that all things vnited have a kind of reſemblance, therefore Philoſophers and Divines ground friendſhip vpon ſimilitude: here hence we love our kinſemen, parents, and children, for the vnion and reſemblance in blood: ſtudents ground their friendſhip in the ſame kind of ſtudies, ſouldiers in martiall affaires, courtiers in civill courtly carriage, tradeſmen in their artes, marriners in navigation: and finally all men of one profeſſion love them of the ſame, and <hi>Omne animal</hi>

And the reaſon is, becauſe a man in this life by nature and grace, by the inſtinct of his innate iudgement and reaſonable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preſcribeth vnto himſelfe an end in this world, void of troubles and moleſtation, quiet, peaceable, full of reſt and contentation: whereat all his labours, thoughts, and meditations levell: moreover, he being a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had need of men to help him in councell, comfort him in griefes, ſuccour him in ſundrie diſaſters of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which dayly and caſually occurre, and finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe peaceably and agreeably with him: all which, none can performe better, not ſo well as they whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and conditions are like vnto ours: for what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention can be among thoſe men, whoſe wills are one and the ſame? what ſorrowes can greatly moleſt vs, where friends carrie their portions with vs, and thereby alleviate a great part of their waight? what counſell can preuaile againſt many friends, who are wiſe, diſcreet, faithfull, vertuous? what converſation can be more gratefull, then that, where neither iniuries are offered, nor ſuſpected? in few, as vertue is the ſureſt chaine wherewith men can be bound together, ſo reſemblance in vertue the ſureſt foundation of friendſhip, and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous companie the happieſt ſocietie. O my God of moſt pure and perfit loue, thou ſpake the word and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got thine eternall word, thou breathed out thy love and produced the holy ghoſt, the life and ſoule of all true love, as well create as increate: thy love in Trinitie is one and the ſelfe-ſame identified in all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the ſelfe-ſame thing with their ſubſtance: and therefore moſt intier, inexplicable, and perfit is your
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21840:121"/> loue, the which may not be termed friendſhip, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charitable amitie of an indiviſible vnitie. Thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are all beloued of thee, becauſe thou like a father in them haſt imprinted and ſtamped a reſemblance of thy Maieſty: and becauſe there is none ſo baſe and vnperfit but that all the goodneſſe it hath, reſideth in thee, much more perfitly then it ſelfe: therefore no child ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth his father, as every creature thy Maieſty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that perfection it enioyeth, and thy boundleſſe eſſence comprehendeth. What ſhall I heere ſay of the image of thy eſſence and three perſons in Trinitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the center of every reaſonable ſoule? this were a matter too prolixe to diſcourſe vpon: but well I may conclude, that if thou love all thy creatures for a darke cogniſance they carry vpon their backs of thy glorious greatneſſe, no doubt but thou wilt love &amp; fauour man, who beareth in the face of his ſoule thy perfit portrait and image in a farre higher degree? much more might be added of the blood of Chriſt, wherewith all ſoules are ſprinkled, who have put him on in their baptiſme.

When <hi>Mary</hi> had murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and for the fouleneſſe of her fault, God who was moſt zealous of his ſervants eſtimation, had ſtricken her with a loathſome leaprie, <hi>Moſes</hi> (as the ſcripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth)<note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> being the mildeſt man vpon earth, could not ſuffer this iuſt puniſhment to be inflicted vpon her, but preſently demaunded of God that he would cure her.

And in very deede, it cannot but proceede from a noble magnanimious minde, to contemne all baſe iniuries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and to diſdaine to repay condignely their deſerts: for whomſoever I iniure, I impayre either his eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or his riches, or his body, or his ſoule: he then that can tollerate ſuch harmes, ſheweth himſelfe ſuperior to

Ah my God of all goodnes and mercy! what ſhall I preferre in thee, the benefits I have received from thy hands, or the not preſent revenging of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thou haſt received from my hart? for in them thou communicated thy goodnes conformably vnto thy will, here thou ſuſtayned diſhonour againſt thy will, that tended to glorifie thee, and perfit vs, this impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thee, and deſtroyeth vs: iniuries were violent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits connaturall; iniuries iſſued from corruption, and aymed at deſtruction, benefits proceeded from mercie, and aymed at the reliefe of miſerie, iniuries deſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, and benefits recognition &amp; glory, wherein then didſt thou ſhew more love &amp; bounty, in conferring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, or pardoning iniuries? Queſtionles in pardoning iniuries for temporall favours, and ſpirituall graces (all except Chriſts incarnation, his merits and death) argue but a limited greatnes not infinit, becauſe a gift amongſt men is thought to proceed from a proportionable love vnto the gift, as for example, if a king give a 1000. pound we valew his love to the perſon who receiveth ſuch a benefit in the degree of the quantity of the gift, and the more he giveth, we iudge the better he loveth, and the more the greatnes &amp; wealth of the Prince is, the greater gift will ever ſeeme leſſer. But in iniuries contrariwiſe the greatnes of the perſon offended mightily augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the exceſſe of the offence, and therefore in ſinne, the perſon of God beeing of infinite Maieſty, the iniurie and offence almoſt is infinitely aggravated: for if a baſe peaſant beate a Gentleman, the iniurie

                        <p>Fourthly, in tollerating wrongs, croſſes, diſaſters, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for vs. This Veritie we finde recorded in holy Writ: <hi>Maiorem charitatem nemo habet, quam vt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ponat quis pro amicis ſuis.</hi> No man can ſhew more love, then by powring out his life for his friend; if then

When Saint <hi>Paule</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians in the primitive Church, Chriſt for whoſe cauſe they endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch perſecutions, accounted their ignominies, his iniuries, and therefore ſaid, <hi>Saule, Saule, cur me perſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris?

Who diſhonoureth an Ambaſſadour, but his King reputeth the iniurie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto his Perſon? who revileth a ſervant ſent from his Lord, but his Maſter will thinke therein his honour ſtayned? wherefore as Chriſts Apoſtles and Diſciples, Ambaſſadors or Servants wrongs redound to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that ſent them, and in very deed they ought ſo to eſteeme them, as done to themſelves, becauſe they plead and negotiate the Senders cauſes and affaires, and in ſome ſorte repreſent their perſons; even ſo, whoſoever handleth or dealeth in our behalfe, and thereby incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any diſgrace in honour, wealth, or body for vs, ought to be reputed our friend, in furthering our cauſes and negotiations, and have repayred all the dammages he ſuffered in our defence.

                        <p>VNto the former Circumſtances, we may for better diſtinction &amp; fuller comprehenſion of the matter, adde 4. more. The firſt is, Vehemency of affection, which appertaineth to the maner of giving, &amp; may be

Circumſtance of Alacritie: yet in very deed theſe two differ: for divers times wee give things ſpeedily, and quickly, becauſe wee eſteeme them not much, or for ſome intereſt, or other reſpect; albeit with no great affection: yet the way to wade into mens heartes, and diſcover whether they beſtow their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites vpon vs, with ſuch intire and full affections or no, may bee theſe. Firſt alacritie in giving is a good ſigne. 2. If in the giving we perceive the giver much preſſeth himſelfe. 3. If the gift be great in it ſelfe. 4. If ſome danger be imminent vnto the giver for ſuch a gift. 5. If the giver be our intire friend. 6. If our capitall enemie, for therein we may thinke, he by a vehement charitable good will, overcommeth himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, if the gift be common to many; as if a Prince bring a Conduit of moſt excellent water into the Centre of a Cittie. If a Noble man erect a great Hoſpitall for the poore, blind, lame, and impotent. If a devout Cittizen give all he hath to builde a Church, Bridge, or ſuch like charitable workes, theſe benefites, as they are extended to many, ſo they are more worthie in this reſpect, then ſuch as are communicated to few.</p>
                        <p>The third is, if in giving gifts among a multitude of equall deſert, one be ſingled from the reſt, vpon whom it is beſtowed, for in ſuch a caſe, affection ſigniorizeth, and love maketh election, becauſe when in the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there is none or ſmall difference in merite, then the determination reſteth vpon the givers good will, which then may beſt be declared, when among many, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one is ſevered.</p>

                        <p>I am not ignorant that the immenſity of mans will may chop and change theſe motives of love in diverſe manners: for if we releeve often poore mens miſeries for vaine-glory, we pervert the vertue of mercy; if ſome faſt for hypocriſie, they abuſe the virtue of temperance; if ſome pray with pride and contempt, as the arrogant Phariſee, they ſtayne the vertue of religion: and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionles, any wicked man may love him that eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniuries, not for honeſty and vertue, but thereby to prevayle more againſt him, and crow more inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over him, to cooſin him the more boldely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve him without puniſhment.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21840:144"/> theefe, and loveth the gallowes, as a due puniſhment and deſerved evil for the theefe. Contrariwiſe, as in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of enmitie, the perſon ſtayned with vice, mooveth me to deteſt him and wiſh him evill, ſo in hatred of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for the love I beare any perſon, I hate all evils which may befall him: for example, a man loveth his child, and therefore abhorreth death as evil of the child; a iuſt man loveth God, and therefore deteſteth ſinne, as an iniurie done to God; a man loveth his owne health, and therefore hateth diſeaſes, or what elſe may croſſe his health. So that here we have three things: hatred of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in reſpect of the perſon we love: love of evill, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the perſon wee hate: hatred and love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one reſpect of perfite enmitie and complete hatred.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, as love levelleth at goodneſſe, without deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or hoping for it, and onely taketh a good liking and complacence therein: ſo deſire paſſeth further, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the enioying thereof, albeit ſuch a wiſh medleth not with hope of obtayning it; for many wiſh Mines of golde, States and Kingdomes, which they never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, nor hope to poſſeſſe: Hope addeth expectation, for perceyving ſome probable poſſibility of purchace, ſhe ſtandeth wayting how to come by it. For example, Cardinall <hi>Wolſey</hi> in his yonger yeeres perhaps loved, and deſired the degree of a Cardinall, but yet being ſo farre from it, he had ſmall reaſon to expect it, but after he was entertained of the King, and imployed in affaires for the State, then he got ground for expectation, and ſo fell into the paſſion of Hope.

                           <p>As in every vertue there is a lowe degree, a meane,<note place="margin">Intenſion of vice.</note> and an excellent: for there be beginners, goers forward and perfite, <hi>incipientes, proficientes, &amp; perfecti.</hi> Likewiſe in every vertue there is a ſupreame excellency, rare, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and admirable; in temperance virginity, in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude apert perilles of death, in prudence preſent reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deepe councell in affaires of greateſt importance, as manage of States, and governement of Kingdomes.

                           <p>Moreover it is to be conſidered, that as every vice hath her intenſion or vehemency in malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo ſhe hath an extenſion and various kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities: for example, theft hath vſury, cooſonage, pilferings, burglaries, robberies: murther hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, lamings, man-ſlaughters, wilfull-murthers: ſo in intemperance, gluttony, &amp;c.

I am moved to abominate it as an extreme evill, for what can be more ſottiſh, then to deny a God whom all creatures confeſſe and ſay <hi>ipſe fecit nos, &amp; non ipſae nos,</hi> he made vs, and not we our ſelves? what can be more beaſtly then not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

No doubt but if Atheiſme once enter into the hearts of men, vertue will be deſpiſed, and vice eſteemed, might will rule right, and the rich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the poore, and epicuriſme wil take full poſſeſſion, <hi>edamus bibamus cras moriemur,</hi> let vs gull our ſelves with eating &amp; quaffing, for after this life no other remaineth, and therefore little it importeth vs to live like beaſts, and dye like dogs: all theſe and many more ſuch like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments demonſtrate the abomination of Atheiſme, and alſo perſwade evidently the deteſtation of the ſame, ſo that by applying the harmes or dammages of the evill, conſidered in generall, and abſolutely in it ſelfe, to my ſelfe, or my friend whom I love, we may eaſily force flight and deteſtation.</p>
                           <p>Feare is a flight of a probable evill imminent: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two things muſt be proved &amp; amplified to enforce feare: firſt that the evill is great: ſecondly that it is very likely to happen: the exceſſe of the evill may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the precedent diſcourſes, the likelyhood, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, or certainty we draw from ſundry circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as from our adverſaries malice, &amp; hatred againſt vs, their craft &amp; deceit, their former maner of proceeding, wherunto we may annexe the impoſſibility or extreme difficulties to avoid it, as their might and our weakenes, their experience and our rawneſſe: ſo that where there is obſtinate &amp; implacable hatred againſt vs; knowledge and foreſight how to overcome vs; power and meanes

                           <p>Secondly, if the iniure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Thirdly, if the iniury proceed from a publike Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or officer of iuſtice whom it concerneth in equitie to procure and commaund, that every man have right, the iniury is greater: as if the Iudge or Iuſtice of peace infame any perſon called before them vniuſtly, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury is almoſt doubled, for the innocent ſuffereth wrong of him who in iuſtice was bound rather to ſave his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, then ſo iniuriouſly to abuſe him.</p>
                           <p>4. If the iniurer were before our moſt ſpeciall friend, for that common grammaticall example that <hi>Amantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> irae a moris redintegratio ſunt,</hi> that lovers ire ſets love afier, and friends diſſentions, renue, revive, &amp; increaſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

                           <p>5. If he have received any benefits at our hands, and in lieu of reward, recognition, and gratitude repaye vs with iniuries &amp; ingratitude: and for this circumſtance we reade that God in the old Teſtament expoſtulating the dayly iniuries the ſtiff-neckt Iewes offered him, he vſually reprehended their ingratitude with commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the continuall benefits he had beſtowed vpon them, as though ſuch favours deſerved better ſervice.</p>

                           <p>7.

Ordinarily the goods of the ſoule are prized above the goods of the body, and theſe more eſteemed then the favours of fortune, and they preferred before the blazon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: becauſe, as the origen of love, is firſt a mans ſelfe, and for it all other things beloved; ſo theſe goods, which are moſt neere himſelfe, and concerne his ſubſtance, or neceſſary preſervation thereof, are more affectually lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then they which touch him leſſe; as firſt his body, then goods of fortune, and laſt of all, ſame. I ſayd ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, for if we compare a title of honor, as to be Earle, Baron, &amp;c. theſe are to bee preferred before a great ſumme of money: yet I doubt not, but if election were given an Earle to bee a beggar, and an Earle all his life; or a ſimple Merchant, but exceeding rich: hee would rather chooſe this, and refuſe that, for there is no miſerie like Nobility preſſed with penury. Wherefore alwayes muſt be held with the chiefeſt of one degree of goods, with the chiefeſt of an other, and ſo the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon framed, as the chiefeſt goods of the ſoule, of grace, vertue, wiſedome, prudence, &amp;c. are to be valued above the life of the body, integritie of members, wealth, fame, &amp;c. I know againſt this diviſion and reaſon, ſome will obiect that common Text of Scripture; <hi>Melius</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Proverb. 22. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>est nomen bonum, quam divitiae multae: ſuper argentum &amp; aurum gratia bona.</hi> A good Name is better then many riches; and a good grace, that is a gratious and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good liking among men; above ſilver and gold. But to this Text I anſwere, that in it are involved good friends, and their gratious good willes, which are favors of Fortune, and ſo to be preſerred before riches, which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21840:154"/> are contayned in the ſame degree. Secondly, fame and a good name ſometime is neceſſarie to the perfection of vertue, and the good of the ſoule, as without them, the Preacher ſhould perſwade but ſorrily; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate be obeyed but ſervilely, the Prince honored but ceremoniouſly; &amp; in fine, take away a good Name, and all vertuous examples wil ſeeme counterfeit hypocriſie. Thirdly, true it is, a good Name ought to bee prized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many riches, but I thinke there be few rich men in the world, that had not rather bee iniuried in their good Name, then fall to begging. Fourthly, a good Name or a good Fame wayteth vpon a good Life, and he that liveth badly, for moſt part carrieth as bad a name and a fame: to our purpoſe then, a man muſt have care of his good Name, becauſe hee ſhould live vertuouſly, whereby ſuch a good Name is gotten: and indeed, ſuch a precious fruite hanging vpon ſo noble a Plant, ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all worldly wealth; and this I take to be the true and literall ſenſe of this Text of Scripture, whence-from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haleth that ſweete and fragrant ſmell of gracious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and contenting of all men: for a ſoule that is really vertuous, and ſo knowen and blazed abroad, cannot but ſtirre vp mens hearts to like and love well ſuch a Perſon.</p>
                           <p>Every iniury then offered, tendeth to the bereaving of vs, of ſome of theſe goods related, of ſoule, body, fortune or fame, and therefore according to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of goodneſſe, ought to be eſteemed.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if the iniury did vs much harme, and the iniurer no good: if it hurt many a Towne, Citie, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, State or Kingdome: for, to more perſons it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, the poyſon is more peſtilent, and the malice more vehement.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, At what end the Iniurie aymed, if he coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to procure meanes to murder, to commit adultery, to hurt the State: this externall Motive augmenteth his malice.</p>

                           <p>Fourthly, if the perſon iniuried, was then preſently doing, or labouring for the offenders good or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: as if an Oratour were perſwading the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale

                           <p>Fourthly, in every particular iniury, the manner of offending, and demonſtrating internal exuperant ill wil, may a hundred wayes be varied.

                           <head>Meanes to moove Hope. § 13.</head>
                           <p>HOpe is a Paſſion, whereby we expect probably or certaynely any future good, or any evil to happen, conceaved as good. For example, the Souldyer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth and hopeth for riches, when he lyeth before a Cittie to beſiege it: the bleſſed Saintes in Heaven live in a moſt certayne Hope of the glorious Reſurrection of theyr bodyes: the Dyvell in temptyng Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, hopeth to prevayle. Hope therefore beeyng grounded vpon perſwaſion ſpecyally of obtayning; therefore all thoſe Motives which render the atchyeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more likely, all thoſe ſtyrre and moove the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hope: and the more forcibly, they which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it moſt apparantly and preſently. This obiect is endleſſe, and hardly can be brought to any Methode, for as the thyngs hoped for, are without number; ſo the Meanes and Motyves to induce men thereunto be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21840:156"/> infinite. Howbeit, theſe generall Preceptes may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, for that Hope expecteth the thing hoped for, of an other, or by a mans labour, endevour, or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: therefore wee muſt in ſtirring it, have alwayes an eye to the groundes and foundations, whereupon our Hope ſhall be built, for as theſe fadge, ſo Hope follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: if theſe bee ſmall or frivolous, Hope is vayne and ridiculous: if they be ſtrong and ſound, Hope will proove more certayne and prudent: for wiſe men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes according to theſe groundes iudge of the event: for example, a man may well hope the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre cannot long continue, becauſe theyr manner of governement repugneth with ſtabilitie and continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for how is it poſſible, but that in every change of Emperour, there ſhould ſucceede civill warres among them, ſeeing the new Emperour preſently cauſeth all his brethren to bee ſlayne, leſt afterwards they ſhould growe potent and trouble his Raigne. I omitte, that this bloody vnnaturall Tyranny (which demaundeth dayly vengeaunce at Gods handes) deſerveth Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rebellion and Deſtruction, and onely inferre, that they being certayne to dye in all humane Policie, nay, in naturall equity, are enforced to make partes, and while theyr Father lyveth, provide Forces and Friends, and after hee is dead, to prevayle by Mayne and Might, that theyr Brothers Creation be not theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, among grave men, few reaſons and ſtrong are more effectuall, then a number, but weaker: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bee able preſently, by the ſtrength of theyr wittes, to confute and overthrow them. But a

                           <p>Thirdly, to gather theſe Motives into heads, I hold it beſt, in that hope which dependeth vpon the good will of another to performe, to diſcourſe over the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of actions. <hi>Quis, quid, vbi, quibus auxilijs, cur, quom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Fiftly, that which I have ſayd of Hope, by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rule, may be applyed vnto Deſperation: for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of obtayning that we deſire, being remonſtrated

                              <hi>Meanes to move ioy and delight.</hi> § 16.</head>
                           <p>AS there is nothing in this life more potent then pleaſure to move men to action, and the attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of great exploits, ſo there is nothing more requiſite to be knowne to any man that will be gratefull &amp; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto men, then how to move and excite them to pleaſure. True it is that ambitious men aſpire after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: but why thirſt they ſo after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe they take an extraordinary delight to be honored? why do covetous cormogions diſtill the beſt ſubſtance of their braines to get riches, but after they have gotten them, to delight in the poſſeſſion or fruition of them? the ſame may be ſaid of all inordinate paſſions which conſiſt in the proſequution of ſome amiable or deſiderable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. And the reaſon is, for ioy &amp; delight are a poſſeſſion of ſome good thing, wherin nature receiveth great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, and therefore a man in ioy participateth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of felicitie, for felicitie is nothing elſe but a complete contentation, quietnes and reſt of the minde and body; wherefore the greater delight either really or apparently apporteth the greater contentation, reſt and quietneſſe, &amp; conſequently the greater felicitie. And as there is no man affecteth not extremely felicitie &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, ſo there is no man extremely deſireth not ioy &amp; delight. They therefore that can move theſe paſſions, feed them &amp; continue them, muſt needs be moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, acceptable, and beloved; yea they may almoſt do what they liſt in any company, for all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> love happines
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21840:158"/> and the continuance thereof: and thoſe that can aptly ſtir vp this paſſion may be accounted authors of a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall happineſſe and felicitie. Therefore I will alittle enlarge this diſcourſe as moſt profitable, if not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for moſt ſorts of men.</p>
                           <p>Firſt of all we muſt ſuppoſe, that all thoſe motives<note place="margin">Motives to delight.</note> which ſtir vp love and affection, conſequently move de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and delight: for love is like the quality of lenity or lightnes in fier, which inclineth and bendeth it to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſier is the motion, paſſage, or voyage; delight the quietnes or reſt of the ſoule in her obiect, and therefore all thoſe cauſes of love we have delivered in the matter of Love, all thoſe may ſerve for this ſubiect.</p>
                           <p>Secondly it is requiſite a man conſider the inclinations of thoſe perſons he would move to delight, for <hi>quicquid recipitur per modum recipient is recipitur,</hi> according to the diſpoſition of the hearer are received the words of the ſpeaker. Some men are inclined to piety, ſome to ſtudy, ſome to one thing, ſome to another: every one willingly hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a world to ſee how blind ſelfe-love maketh women to dote of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it ſeemeth ridiculous ſometime, to ſee how they are fed and delighted with the panigeries of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites. I have ſeene ſome old Ladies halfe rotten, &amp; ſome others monſtrouſly deformed, to take an extraordinarie delight in themſelves, when others for flattery commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their beauty. In this point alſo we may conſider a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motive, to delight in that thing a man is delighted in, as if one be delighted in Muſick, in hunting, hauking, &amp;c. ſome prety new deviſe in any of them would pleaſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21840:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> the perſon exceedingly: and therefore the paraſites of Princes ſtudy dayly &amp; hourely how by deeds &amp; words they may feed this humor: yea ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceeded ſo far in dignifying their Kings and Monarks, that they adored them as gods.

This act of new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing inventions proportionate to their paſſions &amp; incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations whom we would move to delight, cannot but greatly help vs in the way of perſwaſion, if it be plauſibly and artificially handled: for otherwiſe if it be groſſely managed, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

He therefore that will move delight in this matter of hope, muſt exactly declare the certain grounds &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21840:159"/> ſecuritie of obteyning the thing exſpected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of exciting hope, alleaged in the precedent Paragraffe.</p>
                           <p>4. Becauſe delight conſiſteth in the poſſeſſion of ſome good thing reall or apparant; therefore all thoſe reaſons which tend to the amplification or evident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goodnes of the thing, all thoſe are fewell of delight, and ſparks of ioy. For example, a man hath bought a Mannour-houſe wherein he delighteth: to pleaſe and delight him there is nothing more fit, then to amplifie the goodnes thereof: as for ſituation, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in a pleaſant ayre, free from fennes or ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no infection neere it, the inhabitants in former times were of a very good complexion, lived many yeares, were ſtrong, wittie, &amp;c. all which are good ſignes of a healthfull ſoyle: the roomes and conveyances are very apt &amp; proportioned, the walls and roofes firme &amp; durable, the water ſweet, the walks, garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſo pleaſant, as they reſemble a Paradice.</p>
                           <p>5. It is admirable how the minching &amp; particulariſing of the obiect of delight increaſeth and augmenteth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, wherefore the fantaſticall and laſcivious Poets, though vainely and vitiouſly, yet wittily and artificially depaint their lovers bodies from the head to the heeles, in every part diſcovering one or other perfection, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or amiableneſſe, apt to move and ſtir vp delight. And herein alſo all Tradeſ-men excell, for to perſwade their wares to be good and perfit, they will preſently open vnto you a number of circumſtances or oppurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of goodnes or excellencie wherewith their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe is affected: for as they have more inſight, and know more exactly the goodnes and defects of their wares then other men, ſo they can vnfold beſt the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21840:159"/> reaſons which move love &amp; delight. And for this cauſe I would have all thoſe who would move men to good life &amp; vertue, to induce them thereunto, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariſing of the pleaſures &amp; delights incident thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as the quietnes of conſcience, the gratefulnes to God, the honour &amp; reputation of all good men, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the world to come, and every one of theſe the finer it is ſifted, the more pleaſant it will appeare.</p>
                           <p>6. It importeth much in moving delight to perſwade the ſtabilitie and continuance thereof, that it ſeeme not like a May-flower, which is budded, bloſſomed, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in a ſmall time: and the reaſon is, for momentarie and curſorie delights are for their brevitie rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeable then commendable. The continuance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may be grounded vpon the removing of all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments which any way may impeach or diminiſh it.</p>
                           <p>7. As there are two ſorts of delight, ſenſuall &amp; intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; ſenſuall which taketh his ſource from ſenſe &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and intellectuall, which draweth his origen from the vnderſtanding and the will: ſo in every obiect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light there is a certaine intenſive goodnes &amp; perfection, and there is an extenſive: as for example in a Cellar of wine there may be excellent good wine, and varietie of excellent good wine, and thereby our taſte may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the perfection of wine, and with the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of wine. In like manner in all the obiects of delight, we may find a certaine intenſion of goodnes, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine extenſion, and both theſe well vnderſtood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, exceedingly increaſe pleaſure &amp; delight: for the intention filleth and ſatiateth the ſoule, and the extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or varietie taketh away a certaine diſtaſtfull loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe which one kind of vniforme pleaſure draweth with it.</p>

Theſe queſtions onely concerne the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an Emet, but many more might be demaunded, and ten times more, about the ſenſitive ſoule, yet theſe ſuffice to declare the weakeneſſe of our Vnderſtanding. Yea, I will adde an other conſideration, of no ſmaller importance then the reſt, that although as wee ſee by dayly experience, many men ſtudy night and day, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth their braines and eies vpon their bookes, yet I am of opinion, that if we could ſee the opinions, even of the beſt learned man in the world, with as plaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitie, as we diſcerne blacke from white, wee ſhould find in his vnderſtanding more errours then truethes, more falſities then verities, more ignorances then ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, more that ought to be forgotten, then is well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; finally more chaffe then corne, (I alwayes except matters of faith and religion.) The reaſons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to this opinion, are theſe. Firſt, I ſee ſuch varieties of opinions even among the profoundeſt wittes, that ever the worlde yeelded, (whoſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21840:169"/> writings are extant) about the ſelfe ſamething, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and condemning another, both bringing ſtrong reaſons to confirme their opinions; one or both muſt needes erre, the Trueth being one and indiviſible. Secondly, I perceyve the ſame profound Scholers, at one time defending with many reaſons one opinion, and after, with as great boldneſſe impugning the ſame, retracting the former. And why, I pray you, may they not erre the ſecond time, as well as the firſt? for I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, they thought they had as great evidence &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance before, as they preſently poſſeſſe. And why may they not as well reclayme agayne, as they did before? You will ſay, <hi>ſecundae cogitationes</hi> be <hi>prudentiores,</hi> and wiſe men recall their former errors. And I pray you, are not <hi>tertiae</hi> and <hi>quartae prudentiſsimae?</hi> After a ſleepe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pillow, many correct their dayly thoughts: doth not one day teach another? Wherefore I ſee no reaſon; why wiſe men may not, in their retractation as wel erre, as in their former aſſent.

It is a world to ſee with what rigor and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie men cenſure others actions, &amp; with what ſmooth countenance they conceale their owne defects. Let vs not looke any further but to <hi>David,</hi> who never was angrie with himſelfe for killing <hi>Vrias,</hi> and abuſing his wife; but ſtraitwayes, after that <hi>Nathan</hi> had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> the caſe in farre inferiour degree, of the taking of a ſheepe, he was preſently moved with indignation, and condemned the offender to death: the reaſon why we iudge more quickly other mens faults than our owne, partly proceeds from ſelfe-love, which blindeth vs in our owne actions, partly, becauſe we ſee other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects directly, and our owne by a certayne reflexion; for, as no man knoweth exactly his owne face, becauſe he never ſee it, but by reflection from a glaſſe, and other mens countenances he conceiveth moſt perfitly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vieweth them directly, and in themſelves; even ſo, by a certaine circle we wind about our ſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by a right line we paſſe into the corners of other mens ſoules, at leaſt, by raſh iudgements and ſiniſter ſuſpitions. <hi>Galen</hi> to this purpoſe relateth <hi>Aeſop,</hi> who<note place="margin">Galen. de cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anim. morb. ca. 2.</note> ſayd we had every one of vs a wallet hanged vpon our ſhoulders, the one halfe vpon our breaſts, the other halfe vpon our backs: the former was full of other mens faults, which we continually beheld: the part behind was loaden with our offences, which we never regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And he ſayth, that <hi>Plato</hi> rendred a reaſon of this:
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:21840:170"/> for every man is blind towards that thing he loveth, and therefore one extremely loving himſelfe, is moſt blind in cenſuring himſelfe.

Sinne: what rained fire and brimſtone from heaven vpon thoſe infamous citties of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha?</hi> Sinne: many examples more I could bring out of the old Teſtament, as deaths of private men &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſubmerſions of armies, diſperſions of Countries, mortalitie of thouſands, famin, warres, &amp; plagues, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, and impriſonments, for no other cauſe inflicted than wickedneſſe and ſinne: but let vs only fixe our eies vpon the Sonne of God nayled vpon the Croſſe, and we ſhall ſee how ſinne mangled his body and afflicted his ſoule; thoſe nayles, teares, ſtreames of blood, excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, gall, and paines are monuments of ſinne, and memories of our perverſe and wicked life.</p>
                        <p>26 Above all other evils incident to an evill life, of great force to reſtraine our vntoward willes from vice, is the extreame iniurie we offer to God by ſinne, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing his lawe, perverting his order, diſpoſition, and providence, iniuring his infinite goodnes, which ought of all creatures to be beloved, deſpiſing his Maieſtie, to which, as to their laſt end, all men ought to direct their actions. And finally, ſhewing our ſelves vngratefull to his love, the which ought to be affected with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, obedience, and gratitude.</p>
                        <p>27 What can more deterre men from wickedneſſe then their owne private loſſe, or move them more to vertue then their owne preſent gaine? By vice our ſoules are ſpoyled of their riches, their moſt precious robes, &amp; heavenly attire; by vertue they are apparelled: by vice they are wounded even to the centre; by vertue
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21840:176"/> they are healed: by vice they are impoveriſhed; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enriched: by vice they are defiled; by vertue clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: by vice they become dennes of devils; by vertue ſeates of Angels.</p>
                        <p>28 But ſome will obiect, the ſoule is ſpirituall, and her loſſes cannot ſo well be perceived, but if we had ſome palpable &amp; ſenſible motives to draw vs from vice to vertue, then the caſe would be altered. But ſenſible reaſons want not, and no day or hower paſſeth wherein appeareth not ſome ſilent ſermon or reall perſwaſion, to avoyd ſinne, and follow goodnes. Do we not ſee dayly men dye? is not death of the body cauſed by the death of the ſoule? is it not an effect of <hi>Adams</hi> originall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience? Whence-from proceed ſo many diſeaſes, plagues, and peſtilences, that Phiſitians braines are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to know their number, for the multitude, or reduce them to method, they are ſo diſordered. But ſay, what brought firſt hunger and thirſt, ſweate and labour, toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and moyling into this world, but our forefathers gluttonie? What made ſo many poore men, ſuch a number of beggars, but <hi>Adams</hi> originall theft? what cauſeth our dayes to be ſo ſhort, that many drop away in the very prime of their yeeres? few come to the time their complexion requireth; the ſtrongeſt ſcarce arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to a hundred yeeres, but our progenitours inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appetite of Divinitie, and conſequently of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie? finally, the terror of death ever imminent, the dayly croſſes in common converſation, the diſtonſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courſes of the heavens, with their influences, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts and ſtormes, contrary to the generation and increaſe of fruites of the earth, the diſobedience of beaſts, the cruelty of men, the craft and coſinage we

                        <p>29 Wicked men do not only by offences iniurie the maieſtie of God, but alſo they abuſe his gifts and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, not only, like Scorpions they kill their mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be hatched, but alſo, like vngratefull debtours, oppugne their creditours with their own goods: for the vngodly vſe that will God gave them to love him, to hate him; that wit he beſtowed vpon them to meditate vpon his law &amp; commandements, they pervert, by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how to tranſgreſſe them: that hart he imparted to affect their neighbours in pure love and charitie, that they defile with malice and diſhoneſtie; that tongue he lent them to vtter his prayſes, that they blot with othes and blaſphemies; thoſe hands he framed as flowing conduits to feede the poore, thoſe are wholy imployed to avarice and rapine; and to be briefe, that vniverſall body and ſoule which ought to have bin kept in holines and ſanctification, they abuſe to offend God with ſinne and prevarication.</p>
                        <p>30 To conclude, all creatures which God created for the vſe of man, and as ſervants, attended vpon him as their maiſter; all they (I ſay) exclaime againſt a vitious life, they are ſo many trumpets, which ceaſe not to ſound the abuſes we offer them, by offending their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: the Sunne giveth the light to worke works of light, &amp; not to live in the ſhadow of darknes: the Moone with her fecunditie inviteth thee to bring forth fruites of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and not iniquitie: the harmonie of the heavens, the multitude, varietie, brightnes of ſo many Starres and Planets, exhort thee to ſubordinate thy ſoule

                           <p>Conſider but <hi>Adams</hi> fall, how many meanes he had to do well, and yet how baſely he fell, he firſt, by Gods eſpeciall grace, was indued with ſo many internall gifts of vertues and knowledge, that eaſily he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21840:188"/> that commandement: the inferiour parts were ſubordinate by originall iuſtice to the ſuperior, ſo that paſſions could not aſſault him; he had all beaſts, and the whole garden of Paradice, with all the hearbs and trees at his pleaſure, therefore the precept was not ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; for what difficultie were it for a man to abſtaine from one tree, having the vſe of thouſands? He knew moſt certainely, how by eating, into what a damnable eſtate he caſt himſelfe and all his poſteritie: wherefore the event might have taught him to prevent the cauſe: but above all, the perfit knowledge of the ſinne he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, the extreme ingratitude, diſloyaltie and treacherie, might have bridled his mouth from that poyſoned Apple, which brought preſent death of the ſoule, and after a time, a certaine death of the body.

                           <p>Let vs take an other familiar example, which dayly occurreth, more common than commendable: a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man married, which breaketh her fidelitie promiſed to her husband, marke but what helps ſhe hath to reſtraine her from this ſinne: I omit the Sacraments of Chriſts Church, the threatnings of death, Gods iudgement and hell, the enormious offence ſhe committeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, the abuſe of his benefits, the breach of his law, the contempt of his grace, the remorce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the wounding of her ſoule, and ſpoyling of the ſame; all theſe, and many more common helps graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all ſinners, I will ſpeake nothing of, albeit I thinke them ſufficient to with-hold any ingenious heart from prevarication, only let vs weigh thoſe particular meanes
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:21840:188"/> ſhe hath to abſtaine and withdraw herſelfe from this offence, as the great iniurie ſhe offereth her husband, the breach of love betweene them, the infamie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ſhe for all her life ſhall be ſubiect, the ſtayne of her kinred and friends, for her fault redoundeth to their diſcredit, as her good to their reputation, the ſhamefaſtneſſe wherewith God hath indued women, to retayne them from theſe ſhamefull actions, the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and brevitie of that pleaſure ſhe pretends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to that coſt ſhe beſtoweth; yet for all this loſſe, ſhe will hazard it: ſhe neither regardeth the good ſhe leeſeth, nor the harmes ſhe incurreth, nor the little trifle ſhe winneth, tranſgreſſeth the law of nature, the law of God, the law of chriſtianitie, the law of friendſhip, onely for lacke of prudent and mature conſideration married to a wicked Wili, and perverſe affection.

                  <p>Theſe obſeruations then of Phiſitians preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as true, for men that are wiſe, vertuous, and experimented in their faculties ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued (for wiſdome and experience protect them from errour, and honeſtie from lying and deceite) it were good to examine and ſearch out the cauſe of theſe notable alterations and daungers of death in the <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres, for thoſe humors which alter the bodie, and diſpoſe it to ſickneſſe, and death; the ſame bend the ſoule to take inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections and paſſions. I haue heard ſome Phiſitians reſolue this doubt into the influence of heauens, to wit, that ſo manie courſes of the Sunne, Moone, and Planets from the time of a mans Natiuitie, worke ſuch effects; ſo that ſome men, let them liue neuer ſo orderly, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie circular motions of the Sunne and Moone haue warbled ouer their heads, vppon neceſſitie they muſt fall into one ſickneſſe or another, and ſo die.</p>

Make knowne vnto me O Lord mine end, and the number of my dayes, that I may knowe what I want. Loe thou haſt put my dayes menſurable; that is, preſcribed certaine bounds and limmits of age not paſſable: and therefore both Philoſophers and Phiſitians conclude, that a man with manie diſorders, ſurfeits, exerciſes, &amp;c. may ſhorten the natural courſe of his life, but that he cannot any way prolong it, &amp; paſſe the prefixed inſtant of his death: the ſimilitude we haue in a candle lighted, for let a man vſe all the diligence poſſible, the light and fire feeding vpon the candle, perforce will conſume it at laſt; and God or any Angell behoulding the quantitie of the wike, tallow, time of the yeere (for in cold weather a candle conſumeth more then in hote, <hi>Per antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristaſin</hi>) and other circumſtances may preciſely foretell, that ſuch a candle cannot continue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning longer then ſuch a minute of ſuch an houre; in a ſhorter time it may be conſumed with wind, witches, ſnuffe-fallings, or ſuch like things which waſte it away, but longer it cannot be prolonged: after the ſame ſort ſtandeth the courſes and the liſtes of our liues preſcribed by God and prefixed by nature: and ſo God hath appointed theſe Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, and Nonarie yeeres as beſt ſeeming his wiſdome and prouidence.</p>

The difficultie, no doubt, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, and rather I belieue it to be true for the authoritie of Phyſitians, then for any credite I can giue to theyr reaſons; for indeede all that I haue heard diſcourſe thereupon (and I haue heard ſome verie fine wits) and what I haue read, dooth not content nor ſatisfie my minde. Therefore I will ſet downe my Phyloſophicall conceite (for in this ſpeculation Phyſick dependeth vppon Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie) and firſt ſuppoſe that cuſtomes, habites, changes, and great alterations in mens bodies come ſeldome vppon a ſuddaine, but by little and little grow and increaſe by tract of time; and as we ſay.</p>

                     <hi>Galen</hi> to declare the nature and force of cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome<note place="margin">Galen. de Conſuet. c. 2.</note> and what effects it worketh in vs, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this queſtion: how it commeth to paſſe, that ſome mens natures abhor exceedingly ſome ſorts
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21840:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> of meate, and are not able to diſgueſt them; as for example, ſaith he, ſome cannot abide beefe, others ſhell fiſhes; and we haue manie who cannot ſo much as endure the ſight of cheeſe, others of aples: And yet theſe ſame perſons by little and little are brought to eate, diſgueſt, yea and greatly to like them? He anſwereth, that all beaſts and men haue naturall propenſions, to ſuch meates as are conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the naturall proprieties of theyr bodies, and abhor ſuch things as are contrarie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lyon feedeth vppon fleſh, not vpon hay; and the Oxe vpon hay not vpon fleſh; yet it falleth out that by tract of time, thoſe meates which we deteſted, after by vſe become familiar, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the body, and by the ſucke of theyr nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, change the affections and qualities of the ſtomack, in ſuch ſort, as that meate, which before was moleſtfull, and in very deede hurtfull, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſauorie and healthfull: and this he proueth, not onely to be true in men and beaſts, but alſo in feedes and trees, whoſe fruite in ſome countries are poyſon, transferred into other ſoyles where they receiue another kind of noriſhment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not only by tract of time; not hurtfull, but very healthfull; not poyſonfull, but pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is to be conſidered, that our bodies generally haue certaine courſes, paſſages, ſtations or periods, wherein they notably change their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations: till 21. yeeres, or 25. at the moſt, we grow in height, for ſome come to theyr
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21840:196"/> full growth ſooner, ſome later: from 25. to fortie two, or forty fiue, we grow in breadth or thicknes, from this, till the end of our dayes we decline: the cauſe of theſe three notorious alterations is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate or <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> (which in mine opinion is nothing els but the vitall temper, and qualification of euery ſolid part of our bodies) the which reſiding in a moiſt body, cauſeth it to grow, like the heate in a loafe of Dowe ſet in the Ouen: afterwards, what with internall heate, externall drying of the windes, and ſunne, and other conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exerciſes, which daily exſiccate the body, &amp; draw out the vndegueſted moyſture, the innated heate is not able to rouze vp the body any more in height, but ſpreadeth it abroade, and ſo enlargeth, and ingroſſeth it: after which continuall working, heate is weakened, and ſo by little and little ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth: and finally reſolueth in diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in this ſeptuarie number of our yeeres, although we cannot diſcouer ſuch notorious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as in the three former paſſages, yet in theſe likewiſe, we may obſerue ſome markable change. At the firſt ſeauenth yeere, men commonly note, that then the child beginneth, to haue ſome little ſparkes of reaſon: and for this cauſe, the Cannon Law permitteth ſuch, directed by their parents or Tutors, <hi>contrahere ſponſalia,</hi> to make a promiſe of future mariage. In the foureteene yeere, the youth is thought to haue the perfit vſe of reaſon, &amp; then the Cannons account him capable of marriage.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21840:196"/> At twenty one, a man is reputed able iudiciouſly to diſpoſe of his goods, and faculties, and therfore the Common-law riddeth him then of his vvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Cannons giue him leaue to take the order of ſubdeacon: the firſt ſeauen yeeres are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>infantia,</hi> the ſecond <hi>pueritia,</hi> the third <hi>adoleſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the fourth, that is, from twenty one to twenty eight, <hi>iuuentus,</hi> from thence to forty nine, hee is eſteemed to ſtand <hi>in ſtatu virili,</hi> the next till ſixtie three is <hi>ſenectus,</hi> after, till ſeauenty &amp; ſeauentie ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for moſt part enſueth <hi>decrepita aetas.</hi> In all theſe periods, or <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres, it is to be noted, that although the change in that yeere be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moſt palpably, and ſenſibly, yet in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, they were preparing, working, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſpoſing there-vnto: as for example, wee muſt not thinke that the leaſt drop of rayne, which in effect breaketh the ſtone, dooth it of it ſelfe, for that were impoſſible, but it doth it in vertue, and by force and working of all the former: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for this cauſe they were called <hi>anni ſcalares,</hi> for that euery yeere precedent, was a ſteppe to the laſt, wherein the Ladder or ſtaires were ended.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a great diſpute among Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, what ſhould be the cauſe of the Paroxiſmes, or fittes in Agues, and once I my ſelfe being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a tertian Ague, in <hi>Italie,</hi> in the Cittie of <hi>Como,</hi> there came two Phiſitians my deere friends, and a Doctor of Diuinitie all at one time to viſite me, and euen then I ſtood in expectation of my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21840:197"/> fit. After many complements &amp; diſcourſes about my ſicknes, at laſt I demaunded theſe two Doctors of Phiſicke, that they would reſolue mee in one doubt about my diſeaſe: they aunſwered, with a good will: Well, ſayd I, you both conclude, and it ſtands with good reaſon, that this ſicknes of mine proceedeth from exceſſe of choller: now I would know of you, when my fit is paſt, is the choller all diſgueſted, conſumed, and voyded away or no? If it be conſumed, why dooth my Ague returne? if it be not conſumed, why dooth mine Ague de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? The Phiſitians here aunſwered one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie to another: for the firſt ſayd it was diſgueſted: Why then returneth mine Ague? For this cauſe quoth he, the Ague proceedeth not onely of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but of choller putrified, corrupted, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. Now ſir, the choller poyſoned is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but other choller which remaineth, is not corrupted, but by the next paroxiſme it will be corrupted: Well, ſayd I, what thing is that which corrupteth &amp; poiſoneth that good choller, which before was not corrupted? It ſeemeth ſtrange to me, how ſo much preciſely ſhould be corrupted, and the other beeing ſo neere lying by it, or rather vnited with it, yea mingled in it, not to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In truth I remember not what he aunſwered, but I am ſure he ſatisfied none of vs all. The other Doctor of Phiſicke ſayd, it was not conſumed, but nature feeling the force of that poyſon, vnited her ſelfe to fight againſt it, and ſo allayed moſt of the vehemencie, vigour, and malignitie thereof: and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21840:197"/> hee gaue an example of a pot of water ſet on the fire, for quoth hee, if the coales be couered with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, the hote water cooleth, blow the fire and it warmeth and boyleth, let aſhes returne, or the fire die, the water returneth to the firſt coldneſſe: So quoth hee, the poyſon of the choller, by natures might is ouercome, when the Ague departeth, but after that thoſe ſpirits and forces, which nature had vnited, are diſperſed, the fire is quenched, and choller againe corrupted. But quoth the other Phiſitian, ſo the ſickneſſe ſhould neuer depart, for if your choller be ſtill in cooling and heating, and nature now fighting, now ceaſing, when I pray you ſhall this combat be finally ended? Marry ſir quoth his fellow Doctor, in this ſort, nature mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the forces of choller this fit, and allayeth them: now nature in the meane time, is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good foode, and the humour either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or quailed with phiſicke, and ſo by little and little it is quite diſgueſted.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo ſaid the other, for then the ſecond fit ſhould alwayes be leſſe then the firſt, and the third leſſe then the ſecond, and ſo forward to the laſt: but this is falſe, for his third and fourth fits, were much more vehement, then either the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And beſides, by this declaration, no man ſhould euer die vpon an Ague. For if in euery fit, the ſickneſſe ceaſſed not, vntill the humour were allayed, then certainly in Agues, (which are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21840:198"/> the fitte ſhoulde neuer paſſe, which is moſt falſe.</p>
                  <p>With this the Doctor of Diuinitie, who was a very good Philoſopher, and for that he had beene much troubled with maladies, he was like manie wrangling Gentlemen, a petty-fogging Phiſitian at his owne coſts, as they be petty-fogging Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers thorow theyr owne ſutes. Why ſaid the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, may we not hold that the Ague is in the liuer and hart? No quoth the Phiſitians both, that can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be, becauſe no Phiſitian euer held, that any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue was <hi>in partibus ſolidis,</hi> that is, in the hart &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp;c. except the <hi>Hecticke.</hi> Well ſaid the diuine, I ſay not that it is in the hart and liuer immediatly, for that I will confeſſe perforce muſt be choller, but I ſay the fountaine and ſpring, the roote and crigen to reſide in the liuer, the which immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſeth corrupted blood and inflamed choller, for they beeing extraordinarily corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with vehement heate, cannot but engender blood, ſpirits, and humors of like infection and corruption. And by this way I aunſwere the firſt doubt that when the Ague ceaſeth, choller is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſted: Why then returneth it againe? Marie ſir, becauſe the hart and liuer beeing out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in that ſpace of time engender ſo many more peruerſe humors, as oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe nature, ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dangerouſly, that ſhee muſt imploy all her might to reſiſt them, abate them, extinguiſh them. In truth Maiſter Doctor (ſaid I) this opinion I like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21840:198"/> very well, and I will confirme it, for ſince mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue firſt beganne, theſe Phiſitians haue inculcated nothing ſo much vnto me, by word and deede, as to coole my liuer: to this effect all their ſyrrops and waters of Endiue, Sicory, and Barley tended. And with this diſcourſe wee ended our diſpute, &amp; mine Ague: the which with this pleaſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference paſſed away.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Plato</hi> auoucheth, that Agues haue ages<note place="margin">Plato in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. de Natur.</note> like men, as alſo conſummations and ends, vvith whom <hi>Galen</hi> conſenteth: This ſentence of <hi>Plato, Valeſius</hi> a worthy Phiſitian explicateth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As there are two ſorts of diſeaſes, ſharpe and<note place="margin">Valeſius de Sacra Philo. cap. 7.</note> cronicall, both which haue theyr decretory daies, but not alike, for the ſharpe haue odde dayes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeauen: the cronicall twenty, ſixty, eightie, a hundred: ſo there are two prerogations or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of life. the one is common to many, the other to fewe, and ſuch as are of a moſt liuely conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: both of them haue theyr <hi>Clymactericall</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory yeeres. The firſt wee number by ſeauen and nine, the latter wee count by tenne, and the laſt period is a hundred and twenty.</p>
                  <p>To this Diſcourſe of <hi>Valeſius</hi> lette vs adde a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne poynt of experience and doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galen. lib. r. de diebus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretorijs c. 22.</note> who in the decretorie dayes of a feuer, which numbreth by ſeauen ſpecially, he will tell you the fourth day, whether the Agew will leaue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient the ſeauenth, or whether hee ſhall die vpon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21840:199"/> the ſeauenth day, or no: and alſo withall, hee teacheth to foretell the very houre of death vppon the ſeauenth day.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, out of theſe conſiderations we may gather as much as will ſufficiently (I hope) ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Queſtion propoſed in the beginning of this Section, <hi>viz:</hi> why in theſe <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres men commonly die? To which I doe aunſwere, That for euery ſixe yeeres or eight, men ſtill ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppe more or leſſe humours, which prepare the way for an Agew in the ſeauen or nine: As wee ſayde before, when the fitte is paſt, the heart and liuer prepare humours for the next enſuing, and in caſe they be not ſufficient in the ſeauen, they multiply to the nine: if in this they faile, then they paſſe to the foureteene, then to eighteene, &amp;c. And for this cauſe Phyſitians councell theyr Patients to purge in the Spring and Authumne, to hinder the increaſe of humours, albeit they feele themſelues nothing diſeaſed at all.</p>
                  <p>This we may declare by the example of them, who are infected with hereditary diſeaſes, as the gowte, or the ſtone: for albeit they euidently appeere not till olde age, yet in all the progreſſe of their yeeres, the partes and humours infenſibly are prepared. Or wee may ſay, that in ſixe or eight yeeres the liuer and heart which are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of bloud, and origens of humours are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and corrupted, that in the laſt yeere they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21840:199"/> engender more vnnaturall ſuperfluous humours, than can ſtand with the right and naturall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, by this opinion a man ſhould euer be ſicke, for hee ſhoulde neuer want corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours, wherein ſickeneſſe conſiſteth. To this I anſwere; firſt, that health conſiſteth not <hi>in indiuiſibili,</hi> in an indiuiſible poynt, ſo that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not ſome few peccant humours withall, but hath a certaine amplitude, like as if into a But of ſtrong Canary Wine, a man euery moneth ſhoulde put in halfe a pinte of water, euery day a ſpoonefull, at the moneths end, yea the yeeres end, the Wine woulde be almoſt as potent, as at the firſt, yea and perhaps more, if it bee well hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee ſee that Cuſtome breedeth qualities and alterations ſo inſenſibly, as in long time (till they come to a full growth) they can hardly be perceiued.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I doubt not but hee that hath for example the firſt foureteene yeere of his life for his <hi>Clymactericall,</hi> in the precedent yeeres, ſhall gather more corrupted humoures, then hee whoſe <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeere is nine and fortie, and alſo feele himſelfe proportionally more weake, albeit hee can not well perceiue; for I my ſelfe haue knowne a man, almoſt with halfe his lungs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21840:200"/> rotten with a conſumption, and yet boldelie auowch that he was ſtrong, for <hi>Ab aſsuetis non fit paſsio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some will obiect, that wee ſee by experience many menne die within the ſpace of a day or two, who before were as ſound and whole, as coulde be: neyther in their vrine, blood, or pulſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any ſigne of ſickeneſſe, or ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>To this I aunſwere, that ſuch a man was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppreſſed with ſome vehement Paſſion, or ſome violent exerciſe, or ſome other extrinſecall cauſe, which accelerated, peruerted, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily augmented the humour, and ſo cauſed death: for as I ſaide aboue, although a man (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the common courſe of his dayes) can not paſſe his prefixed time and <hi>Clymactericall</hi> periode, yet by many meanes he may ſhorten it.</p>
                  <p>Much more I coulde ſay, <hi>prò</hi> and <hi>contrà,</hi> for this Declaration, but becauſe it were ſomething too Phyſicall, and not ſo neceſſarie for this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Treatiſe, therefore I will bury it with ſilence: for this poynt, in very trueth, is ſo intricate, that I perceiue, the beſt wittes are exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to extricate themſelues out of it.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21840:200"/>
                  <p>And therefore, as this I eſteeme probable, ſo I woulde giue any Phyſitian moſt hearty thankes, who in few woordes woulde teach mee a better way.</p>
                  <p>I ſayde in briefe, for I haue ſeene ſome ſuch long tedious Diſcourſes, as I loathed to peruſe them, doubting leſt the vncertaine profit, would not repay the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine payne.</p>
