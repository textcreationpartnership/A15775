            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome Å¿eaven yeares ago (right Honorable) I was requeÅ¿ted by divers worthy Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, to write briefly Å¿ome pithie diÅ¿courÅ¿e about the paÅ¿Å¿ions of the minde: becauÅ¿e (as they Å¿ayd) they were things ever in vÅ¿e, and Å¿eldome without abuÅ¿e: they were dayly, yea and almoÅ¿t hourely felt no leÅ¿Å¿e craftie, then dangerous, much talkt of, and as yet never well taught. Their demaund Å¿eemed to me Å¿o rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable, honeÅ¿t, profitable, and delightfull, as I deemed it diÅ¿courteÅ¿ie, and incivilitie, not to condeÅ¿cend to Å¿atisfie their Å¿ute. A treatiÅ¿e hereupon I penned, but I know not how in the inundation of my croÅ¿Å¿es it Å¿uffered Å¿hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack with the reÅ¿t of my writings: and at what time I Å¿uppoÅ¿ed it had bin lying rotting in the bottome of the Å¿ea, a favorable gale brought it aÅ¿hoare, where being found (belike by Å¿ome that liked it well) was taken vp, entertayned, and diÅ¿perÅ¿ed abroad. When I beheld it, I wondred, and could not tell whether to reioyce to Å¿ee mine aborted infant revived, or feare whether it had bin maymed and corrupted: for I doubted it had paÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿ome hands, which might have cavÅ¿ed me Å¿peake in a language I never vnderÅ¿tood. At laÅ¿t I fell a peruÅ¿ing of
<pb facs="tcp:21840:3"/> it, and in deede found, it had not bin hardly vÅ¿ed, but kindly dealt withall, &amp; what eÅ¿capes were overÅ¿lipped, proceeded rather from the vncorrected copie (for of three this was moÅ¿t vnperÅ¿it) then from any vncivill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynement. After that the whole impreÅ¿Å¿ion was diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿ed, the Printer made meanes to have me adde what I thought wanting, and to amend that I iudged amiÅ¿Å¿e. And Å¿o I have augmented this edition with as much more as the firÅ¿t copie conteyned. The which after I had abÅ¿olved, it Å¿eemed of it Å¿elfe by a connaturall Å¿ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie to preÅ¿ent it Å¿elfe vnto your Honour. For literall labours are vÅ¿ually offered to Å¿uch perÅ¿onages, with whom they particularly conÅ¿ort: and how could any paÅ¿Å¿ions finde out a perÅ¿on more proportionate then your Honour? They concerne Gentlemen and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to guide them in the way of civill converÅ¿ation: Your Gentrie is well knowne: they appertayne to Å¿ouldiours to Å¿tirre them vp to courage, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: your martiall proweÅ¿Å¿e are patent at home, and famous abroad. They belong to MagiÅ¿trates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, for diÅ¿covery and manage of Å¿ubiects: your place, and evident hopes of further preÅ¿erment preÅ¿age, that this part cannot but agree to you. For me thinks as often as I conÅ¿ider your preÅ¿ence about his MaieÅ¿tie, it Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, with mine eyes to behold an other match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e <hi>Parmenio,</hi> for truÅ¿t and fidelitie about our invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Alexander</hi> of the North.

<pb facs="tcp:21840:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> not but I might Å¿ay to you as <hi>Plotinus</hi> a famous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿opher in <hi>Rome</hi> Å¿ayd to <hi>Origen,</hi> when he entred into his Schoole to heare him reade, who preÅ¿ently at <hi>Origens</hi> aÅ¿pect <hi>rubore Å¿uffuÅ¿us,</hi> bluÅ¿hing, ceaÅ¿ed to Å¿peake: <hi>Origen</hi>

You need not learne of me thoÅ¿e things, which both by Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and practiÅ¿e you have attayned vnto: yet it is no Å¿mall comfort for a man to Å¿ee, either that he knoweth, confirmed, or that he doeth, approved.

And yet for all this, our Nation is accounted Å¿imple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, among divers others.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, let vs cast our eyes vpon all Å¿ortes of Artes and Trades, from the very Å¿hooe vnto the hatte, from the Å¿hirte to the cloake, from the kitchin to the Court, and we Å¿hall Å¿ee our Nation as well furniÅ¿hed, as compleate, and artificiall as any other: and as all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers can well affirme, farre Å¿uperior to the Spantards, and nothing inferior vnto the Italians. I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e, that in Å¿ome one or other trade, the Italians Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e vs, but they be Å¿uch, as eyther England regardeth not at all, or prizeth not very much: but, in Å¿uch as our Countrie esteemeth, wee may, eyther equall or preferre our Å¿elves before them. And yet for all this, a hie-minded companion doubted not, within theÅ¿e few yeeres, to call our Nation, vncivill, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and others, to repute vs as Å¿imple and vnwarie. After Å¿ome conÅ¿ideration and reflexion vpon our Å¿elves, with reference vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, I found out three cauÅ¿es, why thoÅ¿e which inhabit theÅ¿e Northerne Climates, are accounted Å¿imple and vnwiÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>The first is, a naturall inclination to <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ertue and honestie, much more palpable and eaÅ¿ie to be perceyved in theÅ¿e colder Countries, than in thoÅ¿e hotter Climates: this we may proove by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for both Spamards and Italians, if they can have a I lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or an EngliÅ¿hman for their Å¿ervant, if he be alike qualified with thoÅ¿e Country-men, they will preferre him before their owne, for fidelitie, Å¿inceritie and diligence. The very bluÅ¿hing alÅ¿o of our people, Å¿heweth a better ground, wherevpon Vertue may build, than certaine brazen faces, who never change themÅ¿elves, although they committe, yea, and be deprehended in enormious crimes; for the Å¿hame of vice, is a good commencement of Vertue, becauÅ¿e it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a iudgement diÅ¿liking of evill, which is an apt beginning of good. Wherefore <hi>AriÅ¿totle</hi> calleth Å¿hamefaÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e a vertue, not<note place="margin">AriÅ¿t. 3. mora. Nico. cap. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> for that it is a true vertue indeed, (for it moÅ¿t of all raigneth in

The common Å¿ort of Spaniards and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians, cenÅ¿uring our inclinations, with an erroneous iudgement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that a paÅ¿Å¿ion of ignorance, which in very deed, is the firÅ¿t Å¿tep vnto prudence, eÅ¿teeming them fooliÅ¿hly vnwary, whom they ought to have reputed rather vertuouÅ¿ly wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Å¿econd cauÅ¿e is, Education, for prudence and policie are wonne by experience, experience by practiÅ¿e, practiÅ¿e by converÅ¿ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, converÅ¿ation by communication with people, the which in Citties is better attained vnto then in Villages, and in Citties of greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and reÅ¿ort, than in Cities of leÅ¿Å¿er repayre. This wee trie by common conÅ¿ent of all men, who acknowledge the inhabitants of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>townes to be more craftie than the rurall colonies, and therefore I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers are iudged moÅ¿t craftie of all, yet my meaning is alwayes, <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> becauÅ¿e, as Å¿ome Ilanders have little trade, Å¿o Å¿ome Citties no great reÅ¿ort. The nature of mens wittes is Å¿uch, that one whetteth and polliÅ¿heth greatly another, for as their faces are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Å¿o their inventions Å¿etches, Å¿leights and iudgements are diverÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thoÅ¿e that have great commerce with men, either they themÅ¿elves; or elÅ¿e Å¿ee the various dealings and practiÅ¿es of others, cannot but in time greatly perfite their owne iudgements and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings: this we may dayly perceyve in our owne Countrie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Northerne and Welchmen, when they come to London, are very Å¿imple, and vnwarie, but afterwards, by converÅ¿ing a while, and by the experience of other mens behaviours, they become won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiÅ¿e and iudicious. The Italians therefore and Spaniards, diÅ¿dayning greatly to dwell long in the Countrey, and betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves almoÅ¿t wholly vnto Cities, by a continuall converÅ¿ation, even from their youth, become very nimble in the managing all affaires,

The Italians and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards contrariwiÅ¿e, by bringing vp their children with more libertie, enlarge their hearts with boldneÅ¿Å¿e and audacitie, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ually you Å¿hall Å¿ee them at Å¿ixteene or Å¿eventeene yeeres of age, as bold and audacious as ours at thirtie: and contrariwiÅ¿e ours at Å¿ixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or Å¿eventeene, drooping with feare and timiditie, as if they were Å¿o many chickens drawne out of a Well.</p>
                  <p>The third cauÅ¿e is, a certaine naturall complexion and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, the which in very deed inclineth and bendeth them of hotter Countries more vnto craftineÅ¿Å¿e and warineÅ¿Å¿e, than them of colder Climates; This we may perceyve in Italy it Å¿elfe, where the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21840:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> Castilians, nor theÅ¿e Å¿o craftie as the AndaluÅ¿ians. Wherefore, as we proove in beaÅ¿ts, that Å¿ome, by their naturall inÅ¿tinct, are more wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And in this we may confeÅ¿Å¿e that Spaniards and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians goe before vs, for commonly they can better conceale their owne PaÅ¿Å¿ions, and diÅ¿cover others, than we. Our people, for most part, reveale and diÅ¿cloÅ¿e themÅ¿elves very familiarly and eaÅ¿ily; the Spaniard and Italian demurreth much, and Å¿elleth his Å¿ecrets and his friendÅ¿hip by drammes, you Å¿hall converÅ¿e very long with him, before you Å¿hall know what is in him: he will Å¿hew a countenance of friendÅ¿hip, although he intendeth revenge: he can trayne his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿es afarre off, to vndermine where hee pleaÅ¿eth: hee will praiÅ¿e where he Å¿piteth, and diÅ¿prayÅ¿e where he loveth for a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: hee can obÅ¿erve his times better than we for his plots, and marke fitter occaÅ¿ions to effectuate his i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In Å¿ine, he can diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emble better his owne paÅ¿Å¿ions, and vÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe therein more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, than we can doe.

                     <p>God, the author of nature, &amp; imparter of all goodnes hath printed in euery creature, according to his divine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21840:14"/> providence, an inclination, facultie, or power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve it Å¿elf, procure what it needeth, to reÅ¿iÅ¿t &amp; impugne whatÅ¿oever hindereth it of that appertaineth vnto his good and conÅ¿ervation. So we Å¿ee fire continually aÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpward, becauÅ¿e the coldeneÅ¿Å¿e of the water, earth, and ayre much impeacheth the vertue of his heate: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Å¿ubÅ¿tances deÅ¿cend to their centre for their preÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the hare flieth from the houndes: the partridge hideth her Å¿elfe from the tallent of the hawke; and in fine, God hath enabled every thing to eÅ¿chew his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and enioy his friend. Whereuppon grew that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite diÅ¿tinction of a triple appetite, naturall, Å¿enÅ¿itive, and reaÅ¿onable: the firÅ¿t we finde in elements and plants, the Å¿econd in beaÅ¿ts and men; the third in men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles: the firÅ¿t, PhiloÅ¿ophers call, a naturall inclination: the Å¿econd, a Å¿enÅ¿itive appetite: the third, a reaÅ¿onable or voluntary affection: nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e the naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of inanimate creatures, and the Å¿enÅ¿itive appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of living thinges, diÅ¿Å¿ent in Å¿ome points; becauÅ¿e they with one motion eÅ¿chew their contraries, procure their owne good, and obtaine that they need; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the fire by the Å¿ame motion aÅ¿cendeth to heaven, getteth his place, and flieth from earth and water, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: the boyling water Å¿et from the fire, cooleth it Å¿elfe, and withall, expelleth the vnnaturall heate. Men and beaÅ¿tes with one appetite proÅ¿ecute the good they deÅ¿ire, and with an other they Å¿lie the evill they abhorre: as for example, with one appetite a man deÅ¿ires good wine, and with another deteÅ¿teth ill wine. An other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (beÅ¿ides) there is, becauÅ¿e men and beaÅ¿ts, in their appetites, have a certaine pleaÅ¿ure and delectation, paine or griefe, the which affections can not be found
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21840:14"/> in any inanimate creatures. This delight or payne God imparted vnto vs, that wee might thereby be Å¿tirred vp to attempt thoÅ¿e actions which were neceÅ¿Å¿ary for vs, or flie thoÅ¿e inconveniences or harmes which might annoy vs: for who would attend to eating or drincking, to the act of generation, if Nature had not ioyned thereunto Å¿ome delectation? A pregnant proofe of this may be Å¿eene in Å¿icke men, who having loÅ¿t their appetites, loathe nothing Å¿o much as meate.</p>
                     <p>Heere we may beginne, to diÅ¿cover the coaÅ¿ts of Selfe-love, for God having Å¿o bountifully granted vs meanes to provide for Å¿uch thinges as were needefull, and to avoyde Å¿uch things as were harmefull, adioyning pleaÅ¿ure to the one, and paine to the other: wherevppon enÅ¿ued, that having a reaÅ¿onable Å¿oule, the which, like an EmpreÅ¿Å¿e was to governe the body, direct the Å¿enÅ¿es, guide the paÅ¿Å¿ions as Å¿ubiects and vaÅ¿Å¿alles, by the Å¿quare of prudence, and rule of reaÅ¿on, the inferior partes were bound to yeeld homage, and obey.

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:21840:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> there are, as more common, Å¿o more probable, and more conforme to reaÅ¿on. The firÅ¿t may bee declared after this manner: Wee Å¿ee by experience, that beaÅ¿tes Å¿ometimes have great facilitie to proÅ¿ecute, or obtayne thoÅ¿e obiects they covet; as for example, a horÅ¿e, the graÅ¿Å¿e which groweth in the paÅ¿ture where he feedeth, Å¿ometimes they have great difficulty; as for the Lyon to eate a Beare: Å¿ometimes they have great facility to eÅ¿chew that evill they hate; as a Woolfe or a Foxe to eÅ¿cape with his prey from a little Curre: other times we prove they have extreame difficultie to avoyde it; as a Bull to fly from a Lyon. Nowe the authors of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication conclude, that the coveting appetite, inclineth onely to the obtayning of thoÅ¿e obiects which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ily be come by, and to the eÅ¿chewing of thoÅ¿e that may eaÅ¿ily be eÅ¿caped: the invading appetite onely inclineth to the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing of thoÅ¿e obiects which may hardly be gotten, and hardly eÅ¿caped.</p>
                     <p>This explication (in my opinion) as it is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Å¿o it is more vnture: for who doubteth but many both love and deÅ¿ire (which according to all Doctours are operations of the coveting appetite) divers things harde to be compaÅ¿Å¿ed; as, the two vnchaÅ¿te Iudges, the chaÅ¿te <hi>SuÅ¿anna:</hi> and in beaÅ¿ts we Å¿ee they often affect, love, and deÅ¿ire, that they hardly can purchaÅ¿e. It were folly, to thinke the foxe affected, loved, or deÅ¿ired not a gooÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e Å¿he were Å¿urely penned vp, hardly to be come by: or the wolfe deÅ¿ired not the Å¿heepe when Å¿he is defended with the Å¿hepheards dogges.</p>
                     <p>BeÅ¿ides, many be angry (which is a paÅ¿Å¿ion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading appetite) for things they may eaÅ¿ily avoyde, as the Lady which child her maide, becauÅ¿e the floore of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21840:19"/> her chamber was defiled with a droppe of a candle. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we knowe God himÅ¿elfe to bee affected with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to whome nothing can be hard or difficile. Many things more might be Å¿aide concerning this matter; as how the difference, of hardly, or eaÅ¿ily obtaining a thing can not cauÅ¿e Å¿uch diverÅ¿ities of inclinations; for Å¿o wee might Å¿ay our Å¿eeing might be divided; for Å¿ome things we Å¿ee with facilitie, others with difficulty; Å¿ome Å¿ounds wee heare eaÅ¿ily, others hardely. Moreover, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of obtaining an obiect, rather deterreth a man from procuring it, than inciteth to proÅ¿ecute it, and therefore conÅ¿equently it cannot be a cauÅ¿e of diÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But theÅ¿e arguments, and many more, for brevities Å¿ake I omit, pretending after another maner to explicate this diviÅ¿ion.</p>
                     <p>The other explication, and as eaÅ¿ie to be perceived as the precedent, is this. FirÅ¿t, as we have inÅ¿innuated before, God and Nature gave men and beaÅ¿ts theÅ¿e na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inÅ¿tincts or inclinations, to provide for themÅ¿elues all thoÅ¿e thinges that are profitable, and to avoyde all thoÅ¿e things which are damnifieable: and this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may bee called, <hi>concupiÅ¿cibilis,</hi> coveting; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e that GOD did foreÅ¿ee, that oftentimes there Å¿hould occurre impediments to hinder them from the execution of Å¿uch inclinations, therefore he gaue them an other inclination, to helpe themÅ¿elues to overcome or avoide thoÅ¿e impediments, and to invade or impugne whatÅ¿oever reÅ¿iÅ¿teth: for the better execution whereof, he hath armed all beaÅ¿ts, either with force, craft, or Å¿light, to eÅ¿chew all obÅ¿tacles that may detayne them from thoÅ¿e things which they conceive as convenient. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Bull hee hath imparted hornes, to the Boare
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21840:20"/> his tuskes, to the Lion clawes, to the Hare her heeles, to the Fox craft, to Men theyr hands and witte: And for this cauÅ¿e wee Å¿ee the very little children, when any woulde deprive them of theyr victualles, for lacke of Å¿trength to fight, they arme themÅ¿elves with teares. To this explication it Å¿eemeth that the names of <hi>IraÅ¿cibilis</hi> and <hi>ConcupiÅ¿cibilis</hi> more aptly agree, than to the other, becauÅ¿e heere onely <hi>IraÅ¿cibilis</hi> invadeth and impugneth, and not affecteth or deÅ¿ireth, as in the other. And thus much concerning this diviÅ¿ion. How many PaÅ¿Å¿ions there are coveting, and how many invading, in the next Chapter Å¿halbe declared.</p>

The latter five are, hope, and deÅ¿paire, feare, and audacitie, the fift is ire. This number may be declared by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and approoved with reaÅ¿on: the experience is common (welnie) in all beaÅ¿ts, but moÅ¿t evident in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21840:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> wolfe, and the Å¿heepe: FirÅ¿t, the wolfe loveth the fleÅ¿h of the Å¿heepe, then he deÅ¿ireth to have it, thirdly, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in his prey when he hath gotten it: Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e, the Å¿heepe hateth the woolfe, as an evill thing in himÅ¿elfe, and thereupon deteÅ¿teth him, as hurtfull to herÅ¿elfe; and finally, if the woolfe Å¿eize vpon her, Å¿hee paineth and grieveth to become his prey: thus we have love, deÅ¿ire, delight, hatred, abhomination, griefe, or heavineÅ¿Å¿e, the Å¿ixe paÅ¿Å¿ions of our coveting appetite.</p>

The woolfe perceiving himÅ¿elfe weaker than he imagined, &amp; his enemies Å¿tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he conceyved, falleth Å¿odainely into the paÅ¿Å¿ion of Feare, (as braggers doe, who vaunt much at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,<note place="margin">Feare.</note> but quaile commonly in the midle of the fray) yet not abandoned of all hope of the victory; therefore he Å¿tirreth vp himÅ¿elfe, and proceedeth forward; but in

With theÅ¿e two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ions conÅ¿enteth the third, that all PaÅ¿Å¿ions may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hed by the dilatation, enlargement, or diffuÅ¿ion of the heart: and the contraction, collection, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion of the Å¿ame: for (as afterward Å¿hall bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all PaÅ¿Å¿ions) the heart is dilated or coarcted more or leÅ¿Å¿e.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21840:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> but the beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ie diviÅ¿ion I take this to be, theÅ¿e which I will Å¿et downe, explicated after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: FirÅ¿t, all our PaÅ¿Å¿ions eyther tend to Å¿ome good, or fly Å¿ome evill; if they tende to good, and proÅ¿ecute it, then the good proÅ¿ecuted may bee conÅ¿idered in three maners; abÅ¿olutely in it Å¿elfe, and Å¿o we have the paÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love; or as of vs to be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed and enioyed, and Å¿o we have the paÅ¿Å¿ions of DeÅ¿ire and Hope: and if it bee vehement, it incourageth men to attempt many difficulties, &amp; often to be more bold than wiÅ¿e. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the thing deÅ¿ired be preÅ¿ent, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, then riÅ¿eth vp the paÅ¿Å¿ion of PleaÅ¿ure and Delight: Å¿o that our affections are carryed to good thinges, eyther ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olutely, future, or preÅ¿ent; for good thinges paÅ¿Å¿ed, although they often Å¿tirre in a man, pleaÅ¿ure, yet they are conceyved, after a Å¿orte, of preÅ¿ence; either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they were acceptfull to God then, and Å¿o pleaÅ¿e him yet; or for the preÅ¿ent teÅ¿timony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, for the precedent vertuous actions; or finally, for the credite, honour, and glory, which remayneth with thoÅ¿e who were witneÅ¿Å¿es of our good behaviour and godly proceedings.</p>
                     <p>If our PaÅ¿Å¿ions eÅ¿chew evill, eyther abÅ¿olutely, by hatred, or Å¿ome future evill by feare, or Å¿ome preÅ¿ent evill, by penÅ¿iueneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e.

BeÅ¿ides, whence-from proceedeth laughter, dauncing, Å¿inging, and many Å¿uch externall Å¿inges of ioy, but (as wee Å¿ay) from a merrie heart? therefore ioy and feare dwell in the heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I thinke this moÅ¿t true, and eÅ¿pecially in thoÅ¿e paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, which are about obiectes abÅ¿ent, as love, hatred, hope, flight, ire, and Å¿uch like; yet I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e, that when the obiectes are preÅ¿ent, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿enÅ¿e, then the paÅ¿Å¿ions inhabite, not onely the heart, but alÅ¿o are Å¿tirred vp in every part of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as any Å¿enÅ¿itive operation is exerciÅ¿ed; for if wee taÅ¿te delicate meates, Å¿mell muske, or heare muÅ¿icke, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve, notonely that the heart is affected, but that alÅ¿o the paÅ¿Å¿ion of ioy delighteth thoÅ¿e partes of our Å¿ences: the like wee prove in payne and griefe, for which cauÅ¿e commonly wee Å¿ay, our teeth ake, our fingers, toes, or legges payne vs: Payne therefore, and PleaÅ¿ure, beeing PaÅ¿Å¿ions of the Minde, and evermore felt in that part of the bodie, where SenÅ¿e exerciÅ¿eth her operations: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as touching is diÅ¿perÅ¿ed thorow the whole bodie, even Å¿o the PaÅ¿Å¿ions of pleaÅ¿ure and payne; for in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie parte, if it bee cheriÅ¿hed, it reioyceth, if be hurte, it payneth.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21840:26"/> or flocking of humours to the hearte? It Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e, for Å¿ome good ende; for God and Nature worke not by chaunce, or without reÅ¿pecting Å¿ome benefite of the Å¿ubiect.</p>
                     <p>To the which queÅ¿tion it may bee anÅ¿wered; FirÅ¿t,<note place="margin">Why humors flocke to the heart in paÅ¿Å¿ions.</note> that the humours concurre to helpe, diÅ¿poÅ¿e, and enable the heart to worke Å¿uch operations: for as we prove by experience, if a man Å¿leepe with open eyes, although his Å¿ight be marvellous excellent, yet he Å¿eeth nothing, becauÅ¿e in Å¿leepe, the purer Å¿pirites are recalled into the inner partes of the body, leaving the eyes deÅ¿titute of Å¿pirits, and abandoned of force, which preÅ¿ently in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king returne againe: euen Å¿o I conceive, the heart, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by nature to digeÅ¿t the blood Å¿ent from the liver, yet for divers reÅ¿pectes, not to have the temperature which all PaÅ¿Å¿ions require; for love will have heate, and Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e colde, feare conÅ¿tringeth, and pleaÅ¿ure dilateth; the heart therefore which was to bee Å¿ubiect to Å¿uch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ities of PaÅ¿Å¿ions, by Nature was deprived of all Å¿uch contrary diÅ¿poÅ¿itions, as the PhiloÅ¿ophers Å¿ay, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria prima caret omni forma, quia omnes formas recipere debet.</hi> And, although the hearte hath more exceÅ¿Å¿e of heate than colde, yet a little melancholly blood may quickly change the temperature, and render it more apt for a melancholly PaÅ¿Å¿ion; The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on may be, for that theÅ¿e humours affecting the heart, cauÅ¿e payne or pleaÅ¿ure, thereby inviting Nature, to proÅ¿ecute the good that pleaÅ¿eth, and to flie the evill that annoyeth: as in the Common-wealth, Vertue ought to be rewarded with preferment, and vice to be corrected with puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; even Å¿o in this little common-wealth of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, actions conformable to Nature, are repayde with
<pb facs="tcp:21840:27"/> pleaÅ¿ure, and paÅ¿Å¿ions diÅ¿conÅ¿orting nature, puniÅ¿hed with payne.</p>
                     <p>The other queÅ¿tion concerneth the efficient cauÅ¿e of theÅ¿e humours, what cauÅ¿eth their motions to the heart; they themÅ¿elves, as it were, flie vnto the heart? or the parte where they Å¿oiourned, Å¿endeth or expelleth them from her, and Å¿o for common refuge they runne to the heart? or finally, the heart draweth them vnto it? This difficultye requireth an anÅ¿were, whereby many Å¿uch like queÅ¿tions may bee reÅ¿olved: as for example, when the meate in our Å¿tomackes is Å¿ufficiently diÅ¿geÅ¿ted, the chile which there remayneth, prepared to be Å¿ent to the liver for a further concoction; doth it aÅ¿cend thither by it Å¿elfe, as vapours to the head? or doth the Å¿tomacke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it? or the liver drawe and Å¿ucke it?</p>
                     <p>To this demaund I anÅ¿were, that (in mine opinion) the partes from whence theÅ¿e humours come, vÅ¿e their expulÅ¿ive vertue, Å¿ending the Å¿pirites choler, or blood, to Å¿erve the heart in Å¿uch neceÅ¿Å¿ity, as the hand lifteth vp it Å¿elfe to defend the head: howbeit, I doubt not, but the heart alÅ¿o affected a little with the paÅ¿Å¿ion, draweth more humors, &amp; Å¿o encreaÅ¿eth.

                     <p>This InconÅ¿tancie principally Å¿pringeth from the Å¿ame roote, that the inÅ¿tabilitie of yoong men iÅ¿Å¿ueth from, that is, lacke of prudence and iudgement in their determinations; for wiÅ¿e men doe not reÅ¿olve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues verie quickely, but with great conÅ¿ideration and deliberation, and therefore they expend well the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tances and impediments, which may occurre and hinder that they reÅ¿olved to doe. But yoong men and women, for the moÅ¿t part, reÅ¿olve raÅ¿hly and performe rarely, becauÅ¿e that they concluded without maturity, and in the execution finde Å¿ome impediments; for which of neceÅ¿Å¿itie they muÅ¿t miÅ¿cary: from this Å¿ame vnpure fountayne deÅ¿cendes that endleÅ¿Å¿e talke daily frequented by women; for in halfe an houre five men will bee wearie with conference, and barren in matter, but three women will jangle, and never lacke new Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to diÅ¿courÅ¿e vpon.</p>
                     <p>Many things more might be Å¿ayde of this matter, but I finde all bookes and common places, Å¿o Å¿tuffed with theÅ¿e diÅ¿courÅ¿es, that I thought it Å¿uperfluous to write any more, eÅ¿pecially, for that I knowe, that women will be eaÅ¿ily offended with thoÅ¿e that diÅ¿praiÅ¿e them, as they will be woonderfully well pleaÅ¿ed with thoÅ¿e that commend them: yet they muÅ¿t pardon me, if

                     <p>Therefore to conclude, I am not of <hi>Senecaes</hi> opinion, that <hi>Mulier amat, aut odit, nihil eÅ¿t tertium,</hi> that a woman loveth, or hateth, and nothing is third; for although in Å¿ome Å¿orte of women, I holde it very probable, yet I cannot allow it to be common to all; for, onely women that bee of a hote complexion, and for the moÅ¿t parte, thoÅ¿e that be blacke or browne, I take to be of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution, and indeede thoÅ¿e have their affections moÅ¿t vehement, and perhappes, little women have a Å¿macke thereof, according to our EngliÅ¿h Proverbe:</p>

To the authoritie of theÅ¿e Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, experience agreeth, for I never knewe any man troubled with a vehement paÅ¿Å¿ion of hatred, ire, or love, who would not bring many reaÅ¿ons to confirme his purpoÅ¿e, although after he had performed his pleaÅ¿ure, and the tempeÅ¿tuous paÅ¿Å¿ion was paÅ¿t, hee condemned himÅ¿elfe, and thought his fact vitious, and his reaÅ¿ons
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21840:33"/> frivolous. The which experience teacheth vs, that men (for the moÅ¿t parte) are not very good iudges in their owne cauÅ¿es, Å¿pecially for the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of Love, which blindeth their iudgement; for which, <hi>Nathan</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>David</hi> his owne fault, as another mans caÅ¿e; how the rich man, by force, bereaved the poore man of his Å¿heepe, having Å¿o many of his owne, becauÅ¿e he knew, that <hi>Davids</hi> iudgement, in his owne cauÅ¿e, might eaÅ¿ily be corrupted: the Å¿elfeÅ¿ame did the good woman <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuites</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> for the recalling of <hi>AbÅ¿olon:</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the PaÅ¿Å¿ions, not vnfittely may bee compared to greene Å¿pectacles, which make all thinges reÅ¿emble the colour of greene; even Å¿o, he that loveth, hateth, or by any other paÅ¿Å¿ion is vehemently poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed, iudgeth all things that occurre in favour of that paÅ¿Å¿ion, to be good and agreeable with reaÅ¿on, Å¿o there Å¿carÅ¿e can be found any man that hateth, or is angry with an other, but hee thinketh his hatred and ire to be moÅ¿t iuÅ¿t and reaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for in very deede, while the PaÅ¿Å¿ion is afloate, the execution and performance thereof, is conformable and very convenient vnto our beaÅ¿tly Å¿enÅ¿uall appetite, and therefore all beaÅ¿tes Å¿tinged by Å¿uch paÅ¿Å¿ions, preÅ¿ently proceede vnto execution, but men having vnited in the Å¿ame Å¿enÅ¿itive Å¿oule, reaÅ¿on and diÅ¿courÅ¿e, are bound, both by the lawe of Nature, and commaundement of God, divers times to repreÅ¿Å¿e and reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿uch vnreaÅ¿ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beaÅ¿tly motions. Yet I know Å¿ome Å¿ubtill witte would gladly vnderÅ¿tand how it commeth to paÅ¿Å¿e, that vehement paÅ¿Å¿ions Å¿o vndermine the iudgement, and Å¿uborne it to give Å¿entence in favour of them: for, why may not the paÅ¿Å¿ion, beeing in the hearte, and inferior parte of the Å¿oule, permitte the higher portion, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall

                     <p>To this obiection three reaÅ¿ons may be rendered. The firÅ¿t I have largely delivered in my third Booke of the Ioyes of heaven: and in Å¿umme, this is the Å¿ubÅ¿tance. Our Å¿oule being of a determinate power and activitie, cannot attend exactly to twoo vehement and intenÅ¿ive operations together: as for example, wee cannot attend perfectly to Å¿weete muÅ¿icke, perceive daintie Å¿melles, or taÅ¿te delicate meate, all three, or twoo of them at one time, either for lacke of Å¿pirites, or in regarde of the limitted influence of the Å¿oule, which cannot impart Å¿ufficient activitie to Å¿uch intenÅ¿ive operations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Å¿oule being poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of a vehement paÅ¿Å¿ion, her force is Å¿o exhauÅ¿ted in that action, that if Å¿hee will continue therein, Å¿hee can not exactly conÅ¿ider the reaÅ¿ons which may diÅ¿Å¿wade her from attending or following Å¿uch affections: the paÅ¿Å¿ion therefore which hindereth and Å¿topp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>th the eyes of the vnderÅ¿tanding from the conÅ¿ideration of thoÅ¿e meanes which might moove the mind to withdrawe it Å¿elfe from that action, may well bee Å¿aide to blinde the witte, as hee which Å¿hutteth another mans eyes, maketh him blindefolde, not by taking away the power of Å¿eeing, but onely by hindering it from action.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on is, not onely a privation of conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoÅ¿e thinges, which may extinguiÅ¿h the paÅ¿Å¿ion, but alÅ¿o an inforcement or conÅ¿traint, onely to conÅ¿ider thoÅ¿e motives or reaÅ¿ons which tend in favour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21840:34"/> of that paÅ¿Å¿ion: for although the mayne parte of the Å¿oules activitie bee haled away with the paÅ¿Å¿ion, yet there remaineth Å¿ome Å¿parks of light in the vnderÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to perceive what is repreÅ¿ented vnto it, as when we heare Å¿weete excellent muÅ¿icke, we may perceyve Å¿ome dainety Å¿melles, howebeit, not in that perfection wee might, if our Å¿oules were not diÅ¿tracted with hearing; even Å¿o, Å¿ome life is left to be imployed to vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, albeit not Å¿o great, becauÅ¿e the Å¿oule is diÅ¿tracted with a PaÅ¿Å¿ion, the which inforceth the witte onely to conÅ¿ider, what may conduce to the continuation and preÅ¿ervation thereof: the manner may thus bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for whatÅ¿oever we vnderÅ¿tand, paÅ¿Å¿eth by the gates of our imagination, the coÅ¿in germane to our Å¿enÅ¿itive appetite, the gates of our imagination being prevented, yea, and welnie Å¿hutte vp with the conÅ¿ideration of that obiect which feedeth the paÅ¿Å¿ion, and pleaÅ¿eth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; the vnderÅ¿tanding looking into the imagination, findeth nothing almoÅ¿t but the mother and nurÅ¿e of his paÅ¿Å¿ion for conÅ¿ideration, where you may well Å¿ee how the imagination putteth greene Å¿pectacles before the eyes of our witte, to make it Å¿ee nothing but greene, that is, Å¿erving for the conÅ¿ideration of the PaÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the imagination repreÅ¿enteth to the vnderÅ¿tanding, not onely reaÅ¿ons that may favour the paÅ¿Å¿ion, but alÅ¿o it Å¿heweth them very intenÅ¿ively, with more Å¿hew and apparance than they are indeede; for as the Moone, when Å¿he riÅ¿eth or Å¿etteth; Å¿eemeth greater vnto vs, than indeede Å¿hee is, (becauÅ¿e the vapours or clowdes are interpoÅ¿ed betwixt our eyes and her) even Å¿o, the beauty and goodneÅ¿Å¿e of the obiect repreÅ¿ented to our vnderÅ¿tanding, appeareth fayrer and goodlier
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21840:35"/> than it is, becauÅ¿e a clowdy imagination interpoÅ¿eth a miÅ¿te. And here it falleth foorth, as hee which is moÅ¿t Å¿tudious, is beÅ¿t learned; and commonly, he that is beÅ¿t learned, is moÅ¿t Å¿tudious: Å¿o, hee that once apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the pleaÅ¿ure of the paÅ¿Å¿ion, ordinarily followeth it, and the paÅ¿Å¿ion increaÅ¿eth the imagination thereof, and the Å¿tronger imagination rendreth the paÅ¿Å¿ion more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, Å¿o that oftentimes they enter but with an inch, and encreaÅ¿e an ell: whereupon enÅ¿ueth, that a falÅ¿e i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination corrupteth the vnderÅ¿tanding, making it beleeve that thinges are better than they are in very deede. And by this meanes, the witte two wayes is troubled; firÅ¿t, in that the vehemency of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cauÅ¿eth a vehement apprehenÅ¿ion and iudgement of the witte; Å¿econdarily, the falÅ¿e repreÅ¿entation bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a falÅ¿e conceite in the minde: and by theÅ¿e wee prove the imagination and paÅ¿Å¿ions to prevaile Å¿o migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that men, in great payne, or exceeding pleaÅ¿ure, can Å¿carce Å¿peake, Å¿ee, heare, or thinke of any thing, which concerneth not their paÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
                     <p>And for this Å¿ame cauÅ¿e, when wiÅ¿e men deale with any perÅ¿on wonderfully penÅ¿ive, commonly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour with reaÅ¿ons to diminiÅ¿h the cauÅ¿e of their griefe: as if a woman hath loÅ¿t her onely Å¿onne in wars; then to mittigate her Å¿orrowe, they will Å¿hewe her, that death apprehendeth all men Å¿ooner or later; it is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute muÅ¿t bee payde; this worlde yeeldeth nothing but miÅ¿erie; happier are they that depart from it, than thoÅ¿e that enioy it; his death was glorious, for his Countrey, for his Prince, the which among valiant captaynes, and noble mindes, hath alwayes beene prized above tenne thouÅ¿and lives; if he had dyed an infarnous death, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21840:35"/> treaÅ¿on, for rapine, for iniuÅ¿tice, then Å¿hee might have iuÅ¿tly lamented; but in dying for iuÅ¿tice, for obedience, for vertue, with glory, Å¿he hath rather an exceeding oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion of ioy, than a motive of griefe. All which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waÅ¿ions (as you Å¿ee) tende to no other ende, but to rectifie her iudgement, and to repreÅ¿ent vnto the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, thoÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons which might rebate the paÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿orrowe, concealed from it, by the Å¿trong imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoÅ¿e things which might encreaÅ¿e her griefe. BeÅ¿ides, the vehemencie of the paÅ¿Å¿ion continueth the force of our imagination, becauÅ¿e, whatÅ¿oever paÅ¿Å¿eth by the gates of our Å¿enÅ¿es, preÅ¿ently entreth into the court of our imagination, where the Å¿enÅ¿itive appetite doth entertaine it: therefore, Å¿eeing all paÅ¿Å¿ions cauÅ¿e Å¿ome Å¿ence or feeling, more or leÅ¿Å¿e in the body, Å¿o long as they endure, the imagination likewiÅ¿e repreÅ¿enteth to the vnderÅ¿tanding, Å¿o long the obiect of the paÅ¿Å¿ion, and as a deceitfull CounÅ¿ellor, corrupteth his Iudge.</p>
                     <p>The laÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, which importeth more then both the other, proceedeth from a naughty will, for that the Å¿oule, hauing rooted in it, theÅ¿e two partes, Å¿enÅ¿itive and reaÅ¿onable: the will perceiving that the Å¿oule reioyceth, Å¿he alÅ¿o contenteth herÅ¿elfe, that the inferior appetite Å¿hould enioy her pleaÅ¿ure, or eÅ¿chew her griefe, with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, or againÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, Å¿he careth not, Å¿o Å¿he may be made partaker: as the great Turke permitteth every one to live in his Religion, Å¿o they pay him tribute. And for this cauÅ¿e Å¿he commandeth the witte to employ all the power and force, to finde out reaÅ¿ons and perÅ¿waÅ¿ions that all the appetite demaundeth, Å¿tandeth with reaÅ¿on and is lawfull; the which colluÅ¿ion, I take to be one of the rootes of all miÅ¿chiefes, that nowe cover the face of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21840:36"/> the world, that is, a wicked will commanding the wit, to finde out reaÅ¿ons to pleade for PaÅ¿Å¿ions: for this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth, yea wholy deÅ¿troyeth the remorce of conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the carefull gardian of the Å¿oule: this maketh men obÅ¿tinate in all enormious vices; for when the witte is once perÅ¿waded, and no further appellation can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then the Å¿oule is confirmed almoÅ¿t in malice; this maketh Å¿o many AtheiÅ¿ts, for <hi>vinum &amp; mulieres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tatare</hi>

For if we examine exactly the groundes and origens of ApoÅ¿taÅ¿ie from true fayth, and the cauÅ¿es of hereÅ¿ies, we Å¿hall finde them, to be Å¿ome one or other wicked vice of the will, or vehement PaÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which perverteth the iudgement, Å¿pecially when the Religion forbiddeth or puniÅ¿heth thoÅ¿e vices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the wicked will or PaÅ¿Å¿ions tend.

I remember that when I was in Italy, there was a ScottiÅ¿h Gentleman, of moÅ¿t rare and Å¿ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar partes, who was a Retainer to a Duke of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, hee was a Å¿ingular good Scholler, and as good a Souldier; it chanced one night, the yong Prince, either vpon Å¿ome Å¿pleene, or falÅ¿e Å¿uggeÅ¿tion, or to trie the Scots valour, mette him in a place where hee was wont to haunt, reÅ¿olving eyther to kill, wound, or beate him, and for this effect, conducted with him, two of the beÅ¿t Fencers hee could finde, the Scot had but one friende with him; in fine, a quarrell is pickt, they all draw, the Scot preÅ¿ently ranne one of the Fencers thorow, and killed him in a trice, with that hee bended his forces to the Prince, who fearing, leaÅ¿t that which was befallen his Fencer, might happen vpon himÅ¿elfe, he exclaimed out inÅ¿tantly, that he was the Prince, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, to looke about him what he did: the Scot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyving well what he was, fell downe vpon his knees, demaunding pardon at his handes, and gave the Prince his naked rapier, who no Å¿ooner had receyved it, but with the Å¿ame Å¿word he ranne him thorow to death: the which barbarous fact, as it was condemned of all men, Å¿o it Å¿heweth the Precipitation of his paÅ¿Å¿ionate irefull heart: for if hee had conÅ¿idered the humble Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21840:37"/> of his Å¿ervant, and loyaltie of his Å¿ubiect, and valour of his Å¿ouldier; if he had weighed the cowardlineÅ¿Å¿e of his fact, the infamie that hee Å¿hould thereby incurre, hee would never have precipitated into Å¿o Å¿avage an offence.

And for that all PaÅ¿Å¿ions bring with them ioy or payne, dilate or coarct the heart; therefore I thinke it not amiÅ¿Å¿e, to declare the reaÅ¿on, why theÅ¿e two PaÅ¿Å¿ions worke Å¿uch alterations in the body, to the end, that by the knowledge of them, we may attayne to the vnderÅ¿tanding of the reÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>PleaÅ¿ure and Delight, if it bee moderate, bringeth health, becauÅ¿e the purer Å¿pirites retyre vnto the heart, and they helpe marvellouÅ¿ly the digeÅ¿tion of blood, Å¿o that thereby the heart engendreth great aboundance, and moÅ¿t purified Å¿pirites, which after being diÅ¿perÅ¿ed thorow the body, cauÅ¿e a good concoction to be made in all partes, helping them to expel the Å¿uperfluities; they alÅ¿o cleare the braine, and conÅ¿equently, the vnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: For although while the PaÅ¿Å¿ion endureth, it blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a little the indifferent iudgement, yet after that it is paÅ¿t, it rendereth the brayne better diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to repreÅ¿ent, whatÅ¿oever occurreth for Å¿peculation. From good concoction, expulÅ¿ion of Å¿uperÅ¿luities, and aboundance of Å¿pirites, proceedeth a good colour, a cleere countenance, and an vniverÅ¿all health of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But if the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of pleaÅ¿ure bee too vehement, queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e it cauÅ¿eth great infirmitie: for the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually invironed with great abundance of Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becommeth too hote and inflamed, and conÅ¿equently engendereth much cholericke and burned blood: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, it dilateth and reÅ¿olveth the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the heart too much, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as the vertue and force thereof is greatly weakened. Wherefore <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to Å¿ay, that thoÅ¿e men, which live continently and frugally, had more pleaÅ¿ure, and leÅ¿Å¿e payne, than thoÅ¿e, who with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21840:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> great care procured inticements to pleaÅ¿ure; becauÅ¿e intemperate pleaÅ¿ures, beÅ¿ides the remorce of minde, infamie, and povertie, which waiteth vpon them, for the moÅ¿t part, hurt more the body, than delight it. And Å¿ome, with too vehement laughter have ended their dayes; as <hi>Philemon</hi> did. <hi>Plutarch</hi> recounteth alÅ¿o, howe<note place="margin">EraÅ¿m. lib. 6. Apotheg. Plutarch. in Hannib.</note> the Romanes, leeÅ¿ing to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> newes was brought to Rome, and Å¿pecially to two women, that their Å¿onnes were Å¿laine: afterwards, a remnant of the Å¿ouldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, theÅ¿e two afflicted, ranne with many more, to know the manner of their Å¿onnes deaths, and amongÅ¿t the reÅ¿t, found them both alive, who for ioy, gave vp their ghoÅ¿ts. And vniverÅ¿ally, after much pleaÅ¿ure and laughter, men feele themÅ¿elves both to languiÅ¿h, and to be melancholy.</p>
                     <p>Yet the PaÅ¿Å¿ions which coarct the heart, as feare, Å¿ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and deÅ¿payre, as they bring more payne to the minde, Å¿o they are more dangerous to the body; and commonly, men proove leÅ¿Å¿e harme in thoÅ¿e, than in theÅ¿e: and many have loÅ¿t their lives with Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e and feare; but few, with love and hope, except they changed themÅ¿elves into heavineÅ¿Å¿e and deÅ¿payre. The cauÅ¿e why Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e doth Å¿o moove the forces of the body, I take to be, the gathering together of much melancholy blood about the heart, which collection extinguiÅ¿heth the good Å¿pirits, or at leaÅ¿t dulleth them; beÅ¿ides, the heart being poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿uch an humour, cannot digeÅ¿t well the blood and Å¿pirites, which ought to be diÅ¿perÅ¿ed thorow the whole body, but converteth them into me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, the which humour being colde and drie, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole body, and maketh it wither away; for colde extinguiÅ¿heth heate, and dryneÅ¿Å¿e moyÅ¿ture,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21840:40"/> which two qualities principally concerne life.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e PaÅ¿Å¿ions prevayle often Å¿o much with men, that they languiÅ¿h away and die: as it befell to the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> in Spaine, the Generall to the Kinges Navie againÅ¿t the Frenchmen, who had taken the <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi> and <hi>D. Diego di Padiglia,</hi> the Governour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle of <hi>Millan,</hi> who receyving certayne wordes of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace from the King of Spaine, they permitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to be Å¿o ore-ruled with the melancoly PaÅ¿Å¿ion, that they Å¿carce could chawe their meate and Å¿wallowe it downe; at leaÅ¿t, they never made good digeÅ¿tion, and Å¿o with an vngracious death, they ended their diÅ¿graced life.</p>
                     <p>QueÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e, this vehement Å¿orte of PaÅ¿Å¿ions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from an high, prowde, and ambitious minde, and without all doubt, extraordinarie Å¿elfe-love<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the which, although by Gods Lawe they are prohibited, yet by the vayne humours of men, Å¿uch Å¿pirites are highly prized. I remember that in Italy, after the yeere, one thouÅ¿and five hundred eighty and eight, I heard divers Italian Captaines, greatly condemning the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> the King of Spaines Generall in his Navie againÅ¿t England, becauÅ¿e he dyed not of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, for that his Fleete miÅ¿carried Å¿o baÅ¿ely, and was foyled by the EngliÅ¿h Forces Å¿o eaÅ¿ily.

                     <p>To conclude, I am of opinion, that PaÅ¿Å¿ions cauÅ¿e many Maladies, and welnie all are increaÅ¿ed by them, for that all payne engendreth melancholy; which, for the moÅ¿t part, nouriÅ¿heth all diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: for many we reade of that were cured by mirth, but never any by Å¿orrow or heavineÅ¿Å¿e. When <hi>AlfonÅ¿us</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of his PhyÅ¿itians, as in a deÅ¿perate caÅ¿e, then he called for <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> and tooke Å¿uch delight to heare him reade, that hee recovered his health agayne, and preÅ¿ently reiected his PhyÅ¿itians, as not able to cure (by PhyÅ¿icke) that he obtained by alittle delight. This fact I cannot greatly commend, for PhyÅ¿icians and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines were ordained by God, and a wiÅ¿e man wil not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21840:41"/> deÅ¿piÅ¿e them; it may bee, <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> pacified the Kinges melancholy minde, which no medicine could doe.</p>
                     <p>Yet there occurreth one poynt in this matter, not to be omitted, that PaÅ¿Å¿ions ingender Humors, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors breede PaÅ¿Å¿ions: how PaÅ¿Å¿ions cauÅ¿e Humors, we have hitherto Å¿ufficiently declared; but how Humors Å¿tirre vp PaÅ¿Å¿ions, muÅ¿t now be delivered. We reade in the <hi>Machabees,</hi> how, before they led the Elephants to fight in warres, they accuÅ¿tomed to mingle iuyce of grapes and mulberies together, to Å¿harpen and incenÅ¿e them more to battell, and it Å¿eemeth a thing frequented in many Nations, to Å¿tirre vp beaÅ¿tes to fight, by Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Å¿ome redde colour, for thereby they imagine, that the Å¿ight of blood inflameth them to the Å¿hedding of blood: as in Spaine they vÅ¿e, when they chace their wild Bulles, and in Italy their Bufaloes. The true cauÅ¿e, why beaÅ¿tes are incenÅ¿ed with a redde colour, <hi>ValeÅ¿ius</hi> an excellent PhyÅ¿itian rendreth: for (Å¿aith he) the Å¿ight of redde things (according to the common opinion of <hi>Galen,</hi> and other PhyÅ¿itians) Å¿tirreth and inflameth the blood, therefore they prohibite thoÅ¿e which are much given to bleeding, to behold any redde colour. And I my Å¿elfe in Italy have heard PhyÅ¿itians commaund, that redde clothes, coveringes, and hangings Å¿hould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from before the patients, which were labouring in a tertian Agew; becauÅ¿e they affirmed, that red colours mooved and inflamed the blood. Now if the blood of Elephants, being incenÅ¿ed with a red colour, had force to Å¿tirre in them the PaÅ¿Å¿ion of Ire in battell; how much more may we Å¿ay, that if much hote blood abound in the body, that Å¿ubiect, by the force of that Humor, Å¿hall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21840:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> eaÅ¿ily, and often bee mooved to anger; if temperate blood abound, or be mingled with fleugme, to mirth; if melancholy exceede, to griefe and heavineÅ¿Å¿e? And in effect we proove in dreames, and PhyÅ¿itians progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticate by them, what humor aboundeth, for Choler cauÅ¿eth fighting, blood and wounds; Melancholy, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, feares, affrightments, ill Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿uch like: theÅ¿e dreames are cauÅ¿ed by the Å¿pirites, which aÅ¿cend into the imagination, the which being purer or groÅ¿Å¿er, hotter or colder, more or leÅ¿Å¿e, (which diverÅ¿itie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the humours of the bodie) moove divers PaÅ¿Å¿ions according to their Nature. And for this cauÅ¿e we may reÅ¿olve another difficulty, why Å¿ome men are alwayes, almoÅ¿t merry; others, for the moÅ¿t part, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; others, ever angry: this diverÅ¿ity muÅ¿t come from the naturall conÅ¿titution of the body, wherein, one or other humor doth predominate. The Å¿elfe Å¿ame cauÅ¿e may be alledged, why Å¿ometimes wee feele our Å¿elves; we know not why, mooved to Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Out of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and the 9. Chapter, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olve Å¿ome prettie curious QueÅ¿tions, more talkt of and practiÅ¿ed, then well vnderÅ¿tood.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t is, how can poÅ¿Å¿ibly a mans conceite worke Å¿trange effectes in his body? As for example, <hi>Hypocrates</hi> exhorteth PhyÅ¿itians, if two kindes of meate were to

The reaÅ¿on is plaine (for theÅ¿e and Å¿uch like experiences) for the Imagination herein (though erroneouÅ¿ly conceaving things better then indeede and really they are) cauÅ¿eth a vehement PaÅ¿Å¿ion of Hope, wherewith followeth an extraordinary PleaÅ¿ure in the things; which two PaÅ¿Å¿ions awake, or rowze vp the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And for this cauÅ¿e, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times heard Å¿ome perÅ¿ons very paÅ¿Å¿ionate affirme, that they thought their hearts would have broken, if they had not vented them in Å¿ome Å¿ort, either with Å¿pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, or revenging deeds: and that they could do no otherwiÅ¿e than their PaÅ¿Å¿ions inforced them.</p>

And eÅ¿pecially this ought to bee practiÅ¿ed by great PerÅ¿ons, who never (almoÅ¿t) heare the trueth concerning their owne actions: for Flatterie fayneth falÅ¿hood: &amp; hope of gayne and preferment, mooveth them to prayÅ¿e vices for vertues.

                     <p>It chanceth Å¿ometimes, by Gods permiÅ¿Å¿ion, that our enemies (who prie into our actions and examine more narrowly our intentions then wee our Å¿elves) diÅ¿cover vnto vs better our PaÅ¿Å¿ions, and reveale our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then ever we our Å¿elves. As befell vnto S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tines</hi> mother, the holy <hi>Monica,</hi> who, (as he relateth in his ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions) being from her youth accuÅ¿tomed to drinke onely water, was after Å¿ome time by her friendes and parents, cauÅ¿ed to Å¿ippe a little wine, and Å¿o by Å¿ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping little and little, Å¿he came to Å¿uch a delight of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine, that Å¿he would Å¿ip off a prettie cuppe: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened one day, that the Maid of the houÅ¿e and Å¿hee fell at Å¿ome wordes, and the Maid (according to womens faÅ¿hions) vpbrayded her with all the faultes Å¿he knewe, and among the reÅ¿t expoÅ¿tulated this, calling her <hi>meribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulam,</hi> a toÅ¿-pot, or tippler of pure wine: the godly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> conceyved Å¿uch an averÅ¿ion from wine, and Å¿uch a Å¿hame by this expoÅ¿tulation, that Å¿he never drunke any more all the dayes of her life.</p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, a good way to know the inclinations of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21840:49"/> mind, is like the manner we come by the knowledge of the inclinations of our bodies, that is, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For as we Å¿ay, if a man, before fortie yeeres of age be not a good phyÅ¿ition of his owne bodie, that is, if he know not whether his inclination bendeth, what doth him good, what bringeth harme, he deÅ¿erueth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿tred for a foole; euen Å¿o, he that in many yeares by continuall practiÅ¿e of his owne Å¿oule perceiueth not where his paÅ¿sions lie, in my iudgement, he Å¿carce deÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the name of a wiÅ¿e man: for as he may be begd for an ideot, who riding a horÅ¿e for tenne yeares, euery day from morning to night, and yet knoweth not the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his horÅ¿e, and the vices whereunto he is Å¿ubiect; Å¿o he which euery day manageth his owne Å¿oule, if after tenne yeeres labour he cannot find whither the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tend, he may well be thought either very vitious, or very Å¿imple.</p>

If thou tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly perceiue thy paÅ¿sions to exceed the common courÅ¿e, then looke to the end of the 16. chapter, where
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21840:50"/> thou Å¿halt Å¿ee how hard they are to be reyned, and what great, yea and extreame difficultie they caÅ¿t vpon thee againÅ¿t vertue and goodneÅ¿Å¿e, and then thou mayeÅ¿t ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theÅ¿e few rules.</p>
                     <p>Euery moderat paÅ¿sion bordureth betwixt two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, as liberalitie betwixt auarice and prodigalitie; temperat diet betwixt gluttonie and Å¿carcitie; fortitude betwixt deÅ¿perat boldneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿uperfluous feare, called timiditie. Men commonly by nature are more enclined to one of theÅ¿e extreames than another, as moÅ¿t men are giuen to couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, few to prodigalitie; more to eat too much, than to eat too little; more to be afraid when they need not, than to be too bold when they ought to be afraid. If then thou trie thy Å¿elfe, not vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to any of theÅ¿e paÅ¿sions, yet Å¿ometimes to exceed in one extreame, Å¿ometime in another; commonly the Å¿ecureÅ¿t way to be practiÅ¿ed, is to incline thy Å¿elfe to that extreame which men by nature moÅ¿t vehemently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, as prodigalitie, Å¿carceueÅ¿le in diet, boldneÅ¿Å¿e in daungers. But if thou perceiue a vehement inclination to the one extreame, procure to bend thy Å¿elfe as farre to the other; for Å¿o thou Å¿halt with more facilitie come to the middeÅ¿t: as commonly the PhiloÅ¿ophers declare, by the example of a crooked Å¿taffe, the which to make Å¿traight, we bend to the other Å¿ide, and make it as croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contrariwiÅ¿e as it was before.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd rule to moderate paÅ¿sions, we may learne<note place="margin">Solus in illicitis non cadit, qui Å¿e aliquando &amp; a licitis caute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tringit. Gregor. lib. 5. moral. &amp; hom. 35. Å¿uper Euan.</note> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who to bridle extraordinarie and vnlawfull pleaÅ¿ures, was accuÅ¿tomed to abÅ¿taine from lawfull and not prohibited: For if one be addicted to drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e, he Å¿hall with more facilitie ouercome this paÅ¿sion, if he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21840:50"/> abÅ¿taine from Å¿trong drinkes, he moÅ¿t affecteth, euen at Å¿uch times as lawfully he may vÅ¿e them.</p>
                     <p>The third rule to flie occaÅ¿ions, which may incenÅ¿e the paÅ¿sion whereunto we are inclined: for <hi>occaÅ¿iones fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctunt latrones,</hi> a commodious and fit occaÅ¿ion to Å¿teale, maketh oftentimes theeues, which otherwiÅ¿e would haue been honeÅ¿t men: wherefore he that committeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe to Å¿ea in a boiÅ¿terous tempeÅ¿t, deÅ¿erueth to Å¿uffer Å¿hipwrack, &amp; he that willingly without neceÅ¿sitie dealeth with infected perÅ¿ons, may blame himÅ¿elfe if he fall into their diÅ¿eaÅ¿es: Å¿o hee that is giuen to laÅ¿ciuiouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and vÅ¿eth riotous companie, may condemne his owne wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, if his paÅ¿sions rebell and ouercome him. For this cauÅ¿e God commaunded that the Nazarites which were conÅ¿ecrated to him, Å¿hould drinke no Wine, not any thing that might cauÅ¿e drunkenneÅ¿Å¿e; and leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould, by eating grapes or great reiÅ¿ins be allured to the<note place="margin">Num 6.</note> drinking of wine, he commaunded them, they Å¿hould neither eat grapes nor reiÅ¿ins: So, hee that will not bee guided by affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, muÅ¿t diligently auoid occaÅ¿ions. Yet this rule ought not to be vnderÅ¿tood vniuerÅ¿ally, for it is conuenient to find out occaÅ¿ions to exerciÅ¿e Å¿ome paÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to Å¿eeke the poore, to practiÅ¿e the paÅ¿sion of pitie; to viÅ¿it the Å¿ick, to Å¿hew compaÅ¿sion; to exerciÅ¿e learning, to ouercome feare. But in Å¿uch paÅ¿sions as Nature more than willingly would follow, beÅ¿t it were to flie occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as he that will liue chaÅ¿t, muÅ¿t eÅ¿chew much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie with Å¿uÅ¿pected perÅ¿ons, and vniuerÅ¿ally with all women; not looking vpon them, nor touching, except neceÅ¿sitie, or good manners, in Å¿ome few caÅ¿es requireth. The Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of gluttonie, pride, and Å¿uch like,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21840:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> whereunto our corrupt nature is much inclined: yet if Å¿ome man by experience haue prooued Å¿uch paÅ¿sions not to be very rebellious, and that for moÅ¿t part he hath ouerruled them, he may be Å¿omething the bolder: yet let him not be too confident, for the Fox often Å¿eemes to be dead, to Å¿eize more aÅ¿Å¿uredly vpon his prey.</p>
                     <p>The fourth remedie, for noble Å¿pirits Å¿ingular; of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿er mindes abhorred, yet of both worthie to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, may be drawne out of the very poyÅ¿on of paÅ¿sions, that is, when a moÅ¿t vehement and rebellious motion aÅ¿Å¿aulteth thee, when the fierceneÅ¿Å¿e and tyrannie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of welnigh poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿eth thee, when thou art almoÅ¿t yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conÅ¿ent vnto it: then turne the force of thy Å¿oule with as much indeauour as thou canÅ¿t to the contrarie, and with one naile driue out another; make of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 11. 2. Cor. 8. 9.</note> a benefit, let vertue in infirmitie and weakeneÅ¿Å¿e of reÅ¿iÅ¿tance be more perfit, and ennobled: For as in warres the valianteÅ¿t Å¿ouldiours in greateÅ¿t incounters are beÅ¿t tried, Å¿o in moÅ¿t vehement paÅ¿sions, the reÅ¿oluteÅ¿t minds are beÅ¿t prooued. For <hi>IoÅ¿ephs</hi> chaÅ¿titie had neuer been Å¿o glorious, if his vnchaÅ¿t ladie had not Å¿o vehemently allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to defile the bed of his lord. <hi>Iobs</hi> patience had neuer been Å¿o conÅ¿picuous, if the paÅ¿sion of griefe and Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e had not Å¿o violently Å¿eized vpon him. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> fortitude had neuer beene Å¿o heroicall, if the death of his onely Å¿onne had not cut in a manner his heart Å¿trings aÅ¿under.</p>
                     <p>This meane, to mortifie paÅ¿sions, I take to be one of the moÅ¿t forcible and important remedies that men can vÅ¿e, eÅ¿pecially for two cauÅ¿es: the firÅ¿t, for that by theÅ¿e contrarie acts are bred in the Å¿oules, certaine habites,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21840:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> helpes, Å¿tayes, or inclinations moÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ite vnto our paÅ¿sions; and therefore the paÅ¿sions being Å¿trong, they cannot be ouercommed, but by the might of excellent vertue: for as the deeper a tree is rooted in the ground, it requireth greater force to pull it vp; euen Å¿o, the greater poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿sion the paÅ¿sion hath taken of the Å¿oule, the greater vertue it needeth to Å¿upplant it. It Å¿eemeth that <hi>Iob,</hi> after<note place="margin">Iob. 13. 15.</note> Å¿o many temptations, practiÅ¿ed this remedie, when he Å¿aid, <hi>EtiamÅ¿i occideret me, in ipÅ¿o Å¿perabo.</hi> Although God kill me, yet I will hope in him: For queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e, thoÅ¿e pains and pangs did incite him to deÅ¿peration; the which, with contrarie truÅ¿t in God he moÅ¿t valiantly Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed. Another cauÅ¿e may be yeelded, for that many paÅ¿sions proceed, not onely from the inclinations of nature, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humours, but by the very Å¿uggeÅ¿tion of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who watcheth his oportunitie, to take men at an aduantage, and to induce them to Å¿undry inordinat affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for which cauÅ¿e, they are called very often in Scriptures, vncleane Å¿pirits, becauÅ¿e they leade men into vncleane paÅ¿sions and actions. The diuell therefore Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his temptations Å¿o valiantly reÅ¿iÅ¿ted, his poyÅ¿oned darts rebounding into his owne breaÅ¿t, I meane his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions redound to his owne Å¿hame and confuÅ¿ion, dareth not be Å¿o bold another time to inuade Å¿o Å¿trong a Å¿ort, but with all his troupe will flie from it, as a Å¿warme of filthie flies dare not approch neere vnto a boyling pot, <hi>ReÅ¿iÅ¿tite diabolo, &amp; fugiet Ã  vobis,</hi> reÅ¿iÅ¿t the diuell, and he<note place="margin">Iames 4. 7.</note> will flie from you.</p>
                     <p>The fift remedie, not inferiour to the precedent, is to reÅ¿iÅ¿t paÅ¿sions at the beginning: vÅ¿e the remedie for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> practiÅ¿ed for tyrannie, in killing all the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21840:52"/> infants of the Iews, leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould encreaÅ¿e too much, and Å¿o ouerrun his countrey: While the Å¿ore is greene, Å¿eldome Å¿urgeons deÅ¿paire, but feÅ¿tred once, they hardly cure it: Å¿o paÅ¿sions, while they knocke at the doore of our mindes, whileÅ¿t they are a little entertained, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them not quickly, they will allodge longer with you than you would haue them. And the moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ie way of all, and by Å¿pirituall men daily put in vre, is to diuert the thoughts to Å¿ome other obiect: for as we vÅ¿e in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conuerÅ¿ation, when two be brawling about any thing, to diuert their talke to another matter; (for, as long as they continue about the Å¿ame Å¿ubiect, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fall into the Å¿ame inconuenience) Å¿o the beÅ¿t way to expell an inordinate paÅ¿sion, is, to tranÅ¿port the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Å¿ome other matter; as he that will be rid of an ill gueÅ¿t, the worÅ¿e he entertaineth him, the Å¿ooner he Å¿hall be diÅ¿patched of him: and for this cauÅ¿e, when any paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion oppreÅ¿Å¿eth a man, thoÅ¿e who are addicted to Å¿tudie, haue great aduantage of others, becauÅ¿e they may diuert their mindes eaÅ¿ily with their Bookes.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ixt remedie to mortifie paÅ¿sions, is, to bridle the bodie, that is, to chaÅ¿tiÅ¿e it, according to that Å¿aying of Saint <hi>Paule: CaÅ¿tigo corpus meum, &amp; in Å¿eruitutem redigo</hi>

For queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e, he that pampereth his bodie, Å¿eedeth his enemie, and he that will feede it with dainties, cannot but find it rebellious; for this we Å¿ee in wild beaÅ¿ts, That the beÅ¿t way to tame them, is by ill vÅ¿age: pamper a horÅ¿e, and you Å¿hall haue him too wanton; pamper your fleÅ¿h, and it will ouerrule
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21840:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> you. And he that will mortifie his paÅ¿sions, and let his bodie flow with delicacies, doth like him which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿h fire by adding more fewell. Therefore faÅ¿ting, praying, lying hard, courÅ¿e Å¿hirts, pinching cold, much Å¿tudie, and Å¿uch auÅ¿terities, are foements of vertue, and bane of paÅ¿sions: and in fine, how much the more with reaÅ¿on and prudence we afflict this rebellious fleÅ¿h, we make it Å¿o much the more a fitter inÅ¿trument for morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, vertue, and all goodneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿euenth remedie, requireth a reÅ¿olute good will and endeuour to attaine vnto this perfit gouernment of a mans Å¿elfe: whence from will follow a diligent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortification; for Å¿uch a man will not ceaÅ¿e daily and inceÅ¿Å¿antly to demaund grace and fauour of God to ouercome his rebellious nature, reÅ¿iÅ¿t temptations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand all falÅ¿e allurements of this inticing world: Such an one will examine daily his conÅ¿cience, and note what thoughts, words, or deeds, againÅ¿t God himÅ¿elfe, and his neighbour, he hath committed, whereby either vertue is extinguiÅ¿hed, or vice increaÅ¿ed: Such an one will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the morning when he riÅ¿eth, not to let paÅ¿Å¿e that day, without the extirpating of Å¿ome Å¿tinking and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oned thorne, and planting Å¿ome Å¿weet and pleaÅ¿ant flower, within the garden of his Å¿oule: Such an one will not onely preuent occaÅ¿ions, but alÅ¿o arme himÅ¿elfe as well as he can to reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿uch tentations as he knoweth eÅ¿pecially Å¿hall be offered in certaine places and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which he cannot conueniently auoid.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21840:53"/> the one how to behaue and carrie our Å¿elues when we are troubled with them; the other, how to deale with others, when we perceiue they are poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of them: the firÅ¿t I will call prudence in paÅ¿sions; the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, pollicie. The former I meane to handle here, the latter, in the next chapter.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t point of prudence which all prudent men confeÅ¿Å¿e and obÅ¿erue, is to perÅ¿uade our Å¿elues when we are mooued with a vehement paÅ¿sion, that our Å¿oules are then, as it were, infected with a peÅ¿tilent ague, which both hindereth the Å¿ight of our eyes, and the taÅ¿t of our tongues, that is, corrupteth the iudgement, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the will; that as certaine Å¿pectacles make moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines Å¿eeme mole-hils, and others, mole-hils like mountaines; euen Å¿o, paÅ¿sions make the paÅ¿sionate to iudge all thoÅ¿e things which tend to the fauour of his paÅ¿sion, reaÅ¿onable, great, and worthie, and all that Å¿tands againÅ¿t it, baÅ¿e, vile, and naughtie, as in the twelfth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was declared.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon followeth, that at what time the paÅ¿sion is aflote, and raigneth, it were not good to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olution or determination of change: for Å¿ome I haue Å¿eene Å¿o vehement in their paÅ¿sions, that whatÅ¿oeuer was Å¿uggeÅ¿ted them, either by the diuell, or their paÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they preÅ¿ently would put it in execution: I doe thinke there be few men liuing, which haue not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hot themÅ¿elues in this point, and repented when their Å¿oules were calmed, that they committed, when they were tempeÅ¿ted.</p>
                     <p>The moÅ¿t part of the world is bewitched with this Å¿orcerie; for what wicked reÅ¿olutions attempt the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke

What fornications, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceÅ¿ts, and other beaÅ¿tialities are effected in the furious flame of fleÅ¿hly luÅ¿t? All the world can witneÅ¿Å¿e, which I thinke to be too too Å¿ufficient proofe; wherfore <hi>Architas</hi> did wiÅ¿ely, when he found his Å¿eruants in the field, to haue committed once a fault, and perceiuing himÅ¿elfe to be greatly mooued therewithall, he would not beat them in his ire, but Å¿aid: <hi>Fortunati eÅ¿tis quod iraÅ¿cor vobis,</hi> Happie are you that I am angrie with you, for otherwiÅ¿e hee would haue beaten them. <hi>Cicero 4.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21840:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> men, yea, and euer hath ben, that they will contemne the whole, for Å¿ome one notable defect: as for example, if we Å¿ee a picture of a man or woman, drawne with exquiÅ¿it colours, great proportion, and art; yet, if there be but one eye, one arme, yea or one finger out of Å¿quare, men will Å¿ay, the image is Å¿poyled, for that one defect; yea, the firÅ¿t thing almoÅ¿t we marke, is the improportion or diÅ¿quaring of that part.</p>

Many inconueniences may follow, if others know what paÅ¿sions men are Å¿ubiect vnto; for if thy enemies would bee reuenged of thee, no fitter meanes they might Å¿leightly vÅ¿e, than to procure Å¿ome way whereby thy paÅ¿sions Å¿hould be Å¿tirred and put in execution; for by often miniÅ¿tring matter, thy paÅ¿sions

But becauÅ¿e this Å¿ubiect is infinite, I will only Å¿et downe certaine generall rules, whereby Å¿ome Å¿mall light may be had, how to liue and deale with men, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that loue, peace, and charitie be conÅ¿erued: for good ChriÅ¿tians ought not onely to procure an vnion with God, but alÅ¿o an amitie with men: and the world being greene in mallice, and withered in goodneÅ¿Å¿e, men more guided by paÅ¿sions, than ruled by reaÅ¿on, therefore the wiÅ¿er ought to prouide a Å¿alue proportionated to the Å¿ore, and meanes to preuent mallice; leaÅ¿t the children of darkeneÅ¿Å¿e in prudence Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e the children of light, Å¿eeing our MaiÅ¿ter taught vs, how the cic of a doue ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth beÅ¿t the Å¿erpents head.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t rule may be this. All men (commonly) are pleaÅ¿ed with them, whom they Å¿ee affected with thoÅ¿e paÅ¿sions whereunto they are Å¿ubiect and inclined. This rule, both experience teacheth, and reaÅ¿on prooueth.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21840:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> We Å¿ee that lyons, tygres, and leopards, whoÅ¿e inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are moÅ¿t cruell, whoÅ¿e paÅ¿sions moÅ¿t fierce, yet one affecteth another and liueth in quiet Å¿ocietie, for the Å¿imilitude of inclinations, and likelineÅ¿Å¿e of paÅ¿sions. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> asked a pyrat that was taken and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, How he durÅ¿t be Å¿o bold to infeÅ¿t the Å¿eas, and Å¿poyle the commerceries? he anÅ¿wered, That he played the pyrat but with one Å¿hip, and his MaieÅ¿tie with a huge nauie: the which Å¿aying Å¿o pleaÅ¿ed <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he pardoned his life, and graunted him libertie: Å¿o much could the Å¿imilitude of action tranÅ¿port the kings affection. The reaÅ¿on alÅ¿o of this rule may eaÅ¿ily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: becauÅ¿e all likelineÅ¿Å¿e cauÅ¿eth loue, and as euery one iudgeth, he doth the beÅ¿t, or at leaÅ¿t, approoueth well; euen Å¿o, he cannot diÅ¿prooue, but allow the Å¿ame in others. Hereupon followeth, that if thou wilt pleaÅ¿e thy maÅ¿ter or friend, thou muÅ¿t apparrell thy Å¿elfe with his affections, and loue where he loueth, and hate where he hateth: and vniuerÅ¿ally, to Å¿ooth other mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, plaineth the way to friendÅ¿hip and amitie: and as this meane foÅ¿tereth flatterie, if it be abuÅ¿ed, Å¿o it nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿heth charitie, if it be well vÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>Out of this rule we may deduce the Å¿econd, which ought no leÅ¿Å¿e to be obÅ¿erued in conuerÅ¿ation than the former, That men commonly hate thoÅ¿e whome they know to be of contrarie paÅ¿sions: whereupon procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that common Prouerbe, He that hateth whome I loue, how can he loue me? for as fire with fire doe neuer iarre, Å¿o fire and water can neuer agree. But in the next Booke, which Å¿hall be of Loue, I pretend to diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e better this rule, becauÅ¿e, as Å¿imilitude cauÅ¿eth

Therefore I omit to declare how Å¿ometimes likelineÅ¿Å¿e of paÅ¿sions engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth contention, as we Å¿ay, <hi>Figulus figulum odit,</hi> one potter hateth another; and, <hi>Inter Å¿uperbos Å¿emper Å¿unt iurgia;</hi> among prowd men there are euer brawlings: for if Å¿imilitude of paÅ¿sions preiudicateth profit, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿Å¿e of affections cauÅ¿eth diÅ¿Å¿ention.</p>
                     <p>The third rule. Be not too credulous to men in their owne cauÅ¿es: for as Å¿elfe-loue for the moÅ¿t part conceiues what appertaineth to our Å¿elues, with a greater Å¿hew of good and honeÅ¿tie, than indeed the thing carrieth with it; Å¿o, men mooued therewith, declare the matter as they conceiue it: for words Å¿pring from conceits, theÅ¿e are the tree, thoÅ¿e the flowers and leaues, which doe follow by iuÅ¿t proportion.

By this example we Å¿ee proued, that commonly wiÅ¿e Rhetoricians affirme, that Rhetorike in an ill cauÅ¿e, is a two edged Å¿word in the hand of a furious man. Yet I would not by this condemne the facultie of eloquence, which I confeÅ¿Å¿e, if it be well vÅ¿ed, to be moÅ¿t profitable for the Church and common-weale: but becauÅ¿e at this preÅ¿ent it is Å¿ophiÅ¿ticated, by many, who couer Å¿tincking matters with fragrant flowers, and with a few Å¿ugred words temper the gall of their pernicious obiects; therefore euery wiÅ¿e man ought rather to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Orators reaÅ¿ons, than to follow his intent with a Å¿educed affection.</p>
                     <p>The fift rule.

The reaÅ¿on of this rule may well be gathered out of that wee haue hitherto deliuered: for contrarie paÅ¿sions breed hatred and diÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21840:59"/> wherefore hee that is paÅ¿sionat, will hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uaded by him whom hee conceiueth contrarie to him: yea often thoÅ¿e that at other times were good friendes, in time of paÅ¿sions for Å¿ome Å¿uch oppoÅ¿ition, fall into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e contention; for as we Å¿ee, when a houÅ¿e in the midÅ¿t of the Å¿treete is vehementlie inflamed, it were bootleÅ¿Å¿e to quench the flame with water, but the beÅ¿t remedie, and commonly practiÅ¿ed, is to pull downe the next houÅ¿es, that thereby the lacke of foement might diminiÅ¿h the flame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>Å¿o, him that rageth with anger, hardly you Å¿hall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaÅ¿e by wrangling or chiding; but either anÅ¿were mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for <hi>Mollis reÅ¿ponÅ¿io mitigat iram,</hi> a Å¿oft anÅ¿were mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigateth anger: or, aunÅ¿were nothing, withdrawing the matter of anger from Å¿ight: the Å¿ame in vehement luÅ¿t or Å¿adnes may bee practiÅ¿ed, as in the particular TreatiÅ¿es Å¿hall be deliuered.</p>
                     <p>This rule holdeth vniuerÅ¿ally in all thoÅ¿e which be our equalles, or at the leaÅ¿t doe not much exceed vs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate, or wee them. But if a Å¿uperiour, or a magiÅ¿trat Å¿ee his inferior, or Å¿ubiect, vehemently caried in any paÅ¿sion, he may threaten, or reprehend him, becauÅ¿e one paÅ¿sion often cureth another: Å¿o here the paÅ¿sion of feare may expell the paÅ¿sion of anger, luÅ¿t, or what elÅ¿e Å¿oeuer tempteth, either to the paÅ¿sionats euill, or any diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the common-weale: albeit, if the paÅ¿sion tend not preÅ¿ently to Å¿ome Å¿inne or great offence, better I hold it to deferre Å¿uch reprehenÅ¿ions till the Å¿ubiect be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of them.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿ixt rule. No man ought to be employed to any office, act, or exerciÅ¿e, contrarie to his naturall paÅ¿sions and inclination. This rule concerneth all Å¿orts of Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21840:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the imployments of their Å¿ubiects, all parents for the education of their children, Å¿choolemaiÅ¿ters for the training vp of their Å¿chollers. The ground of this rule dependeth of long experience, and reaÅ¿on. For by experience we learne, that men be oftentimes imployed to one trade, and neuer can profit therein: contrariwiÅ¿e, when either they of themÅ¿elues, or others, do change that courÅ¿e to another, whereunto they were inclined, they become very excellent men. I knew one in Flaunders imployed of his friends to be a marchant againÅ¿t his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but he neuer Å¿carce could abide to deale in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiÅ¿e: and Å¿o at laÅ¿t therwith awearied, left them, and turned his courÅ¿e to Å¿tudie, wherein he excelled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the rareÅ¿t preachers there; I my Å¿elfe heard him preach after, very godly and learnedly: a hundred Å¿uch examples I could bring you. ReaÅ¿on alÅ¿o prooueth the Å¿ame moÅ¿t manifeÅ¿tly: for three things are required of neceÅ¿sitie, to attaine to the perfection of any Å¿cience, cunning, or office; Nature, Art, &amp; practiÅ¿e: Nature affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth capacitie of wit, Å¿trength of bodie, and inclination of mind; the which inclination, if it be lacking, the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect Å¿triueth againÅ¿t the Å¿treame, and although by force and conÅ¿traint, <hi>nolens, volens,</hi> he follow Å¿uch a trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t his mind, he may peraduenture doe Å¿ome thing with great difficultie, the which labor if he had beÅ¿tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that thing whereunto he was inclined, he would haue become a moÅ¿t excellent man.</p>
                     <p>This rule may not be vnderÅ¿tood Å¿o abÅ¿olutely, but that it admitteth Å¿ome limitation; for Å¿ome contrarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or paÅ¿sion proceedeth not from defect of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or abilitie of mind, but from an ill and vitious Å¿elfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21840:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> or wilfulneÅ¿Å¿e: and then it were good with Å¿weet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and inticements to allure Å¿uch a perÅ¿on to follow that Å¿cience, art, or trade, whereunto nature moÅ¿t incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him. Another exception is, if the impediments of Nature bee but Å¿mall, and the habiliments otherwiÅ¿e great, then the one ought to ouerrule the other; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little labour in ouercomming the impediment, will follow a great facilitie in the atchieuement of the reÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿euenth rule Å¿erueth for great perÅ¿ons, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly neuer reÅ¿iÅ¿t their paÅ¿sions: therefore if a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand once their inordinat affections, he may be very well aÅ¿Å¿ured to haue gained much ground in preuailing with them. And therefore wee Å¿ee vÅ¿ually, that if men Å¿ee Å¿uch perÅ¿ons addicted to this or that affection, to win their good wils, they will foÅ¿ter vp Å¿uch fancies; if they be delighted in muÅ¿icke, they preÅ¿ent them with inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if in riding with horÅ¿es, if in hunting with dogs, if in Å¿tudie with literall labours, &amp;c. for by thus feeding their fancies, they win their friendÅ¿hip.</p>
                     <p>Finally, there be generall hinderances, common to all, or moÅ¿t men, to get vertue and learning, and thoÅ¿e ought by diligence and labor to be cut off; for the Å¿weet fruits of vertue Å¿pring from bitter rootes of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the praiÅ¿e of learning proceedeth from induÅ¿trie and labour: therefore let no man perÅ¿uade himÅ¿elfe to attaine vnto any Å¿ingular cunning, except his labour be Å¿ingular.</p>
                     <p>Many more rules might be here deliuered, as that prowd men be pleaÅ¿ed with praiÅ¿es, honor, and account; diÅ¿contented with compariÅ¿ons, with commending their equals, in not yeelding them honour, in diÅ¿paraging their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21840:60"/> actions. Milde, modeÅ¿t, humble, meeke, are beloued vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerÅ¿ally, becauÅ¿e we thinke them vertuous, who will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or not contemne vs. If thou wouldeÅ¿t obtaine any fauour, or inuite any man to pleaÅ¿ure, it were good to take him at Å¿uch times as he is merrily diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, as after meat. If thou wilt induce him to penÅ¿iueneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿orrow for his Å¿innes, the feare of God, or any Å¿ad paÅ¿sion, take him at Å¿uch times as melancholie moÅ¿t oppreÅ¿Å¿eth him; in darke and cloudie dayes, in the morning, in Winter, or in fine, at Å¿uch Å¿eaÅ¿ons as that paÅ¿sion raigneth ouer him. TheÅ¿e and many more I could Å¿et downe, but the order of method requireth they Å¿hould bee allotted to particular TreatiÅ¿es. Wherefore I will conclude this Chapter with this Å¿entence: That as hee is imprudent which hath Å¿trong paÅ¿sions, and endeuoureth not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale them from others, Å¿o he may be accounted vnpolliticke, who knoweth another mans paÅ¿sions, and cannot preuaile againÅ¿t them.</p>

If they pen any thing to bee preÅ¿ented vnto the view of the world, you Å¿hal euer haue one new coined word or other which neuer Å¿aw light before it iÅ¿Å¿ued out of the mint of their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21840:65"/> imagination, and it will beÅ¿eeme them as well as a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coks fether a fooles cap. I heard once one of theÅ¿e worthy paroliÅ¿ts who had got by the end the word <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricat;</hi> he comming among as wiÅ¿e men as him Å¿elfe, tould them, that Å¿uch a gentleman and he did beare moÅ¿t <hi>intricat</hi> loue one to another: he would haue Å¿aid intier.

                        <p>SOme men will diÅ¿pute, or rather wrangle about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exceeding their capacitie, as a Cobler of Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a Tailor of Diuinitie, a Farmer of PhyÅ¿icke, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Martiall affaires: and in fine, a number of men will meddle with thoÅ¿e matters, which either Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e their capacitie, or at the leaÅ¿t, they vnderÅ¿tand not, for lacke of exerciÅ¿e, Å¿tudie, or practiÅ¿e. Sometimes I haue heard theÅ¿e batchellors hold talke Å¿o wilfully and obÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly, in matters of PhiloÅ¿ophie and Diuinitie, with Å¿uch groÅ¿Å¿e errours and abÅ¿urdities, that any wiÅ¿e man would either haue deÅ¿piÅ¿ed them for malapert and contentious, or elÅ¿e haue regiÅ¿tred them in the predicament of fooles.</p>
                        <p>And without all queÅ¿tion, this manner of Å¿peech, or wrangling, or let vs call it diÅ¿putation, cannot but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from great ignorance and arrogancie: for no wiÅ¿e man will contend in Å¿uch matters as he knoweth not. Whereupon came that Å¿aying of <hi>AriÅ¿totle;</hi> Euery man ought to be credited in his Art: and that other common prouerbe; Let not the cobler paÅ¿Å¿e his pantofle. For confirmation hereof, I will bring no better argument than euery mans common experience. There is no man (I thinke) but commonly he applieth himÅ¿elfe to one thing or other, this trade or that, Å¿ome Å¿tudie or art: as for example, a Printer, or a GoldÅ¿mith; if another man ignorant of his art, Å¿hould come and diÅ¿pute with him,

Neither for this I diÅ¿allow Å¿ome good wits, to propound their difficulties which occurre in matters wherein they are not practiÅ¿ed; as for Lawyers in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, PhyÅ¿itians in Law, and Diuines in PhyÅ¿icke, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Å¿uch men as commonly are accounted learned in thoÅ¿e faculties; yet not to contend much, becauÅ¿e the further they paÅ¿Å¿e forward, the harder it will be for them to wind out againe. This rule admitteth Å¿ome exception; for I haue knowne Diuines very good PhyÅ¿itians, and Lawyers not altogether ignorant of Diuinitie, yea and PhyÅ¿itians practiÅ¿ed in them both; in Å¿uch caÅ¿es often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoÅ¿e of one profeÅ¿sion may excell thoÅ¿e of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but this I hold for very rare, becauÅ¿e, he that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth his wit to many Å¿ciences, commonly cannot be excellent in any. Wherefore men that be vnlearned, but diÅ¿creet, either will not moue any queÅ¿tions in Å¿uch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as paÅ¿Å¿e beyond the Å¿phere of their capacities, or elÅ¿e in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as they rather intend to learne than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.

They will come to you very Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, and deliuer a Å¿mooth tale in Å¿ecret, and coniure you, that in no caÅ¿e you Å¿hould reueale it: you promiÅ¿e and performe it, but your friend will not keepe that Å¿ecret, for he preÅ¿ently, when your backe is turned, will doe as much to another, the Å¿econd, and third; and Å¿o in fine, you Å¿hall haue that publique which was conceiued for Å¿ecret. This couÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage proceedeth from craftineÅ¿Å¿e, and diÅ¿Å¿embling friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21840:70"/> becauÅ¿e true friendÅ¿hip admitteth not many to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in Å¿ecrets.

I haue knowne diuers great perÅ¿ons Å¿ubiect to this paÅ¿sion, but afterwards greatly croÅ¿Å¿ed thereby, for thoÅ¿e which once perceiued their humours, would neuer keepe cloÅ¿e any of their Å¿ecrets, and Å¿o by their pollicie they gained a reward like vnto liars, who though they Å¿ay truth are not beleeued; euen Å¿o, Å¿uch coyners of Å¿ecrets haue not their Å¿ecrets concealed, although they Å¿peake Å¿ecrets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: and one Å¿peaking of Å¿uch a perÅ¿on Å¿aid, he reuealed Å¿ecrets to the whole citie: as who Å¿hould Å¿ay, he Å¿old his Å¿ecrets publiquely and the wiÅ¿er Å¿ort would laugh in their Å¿leeues to heare him Å¿peake of Å¿ecrecie.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21840:70"/> all he knew of his friend, becauÅ¿e he beleeued his friend in very deed had betrayed him; whereas, for the moÅ¿t part, all was but a bait, forged to catch the Å¿eely Å¿imple Å¿oule. PreÅ¿ently after, they conuent the other, whom in Å¿ecret they tell all they had fiÅ¿hed out of his friend, in his diÅ¿praiÅ¿e, and Å¿o learne what they can of the other, charging him withall, in no caÅ¿e to manifeÅ¿t that he heard to the other. This Å¿tratageme I know many politique Å¿uperiors to haue frequented, and Å¿ome perÅ¿ons of great pollicie, but of moÅ¿t Å¿mall conÅ¿cience. BecauÅ¿e this wicked inuention proceedeth from a moÅ¿t malicious vncharitable, and enuious mind, which hateth the peace and concord of friends; it argueth alÅ¿o, a craftie poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique wit, apt to Å¿ift out other mens actions: for he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teth the poore man into an inextricable labyrinth: for forcing him to Å¿weare, he cannot examine whether his friend Å¿poke Å¿o ill of him, or no; leÅ¿t by the notice thereof he Å¿hould incur the crime of periurie: neither can he tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat in his mind, that his friend Å¿hould Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly abuÅ¿e him: wherefore he reÅ¿olueth himÅ¿elfe, either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to breake friendÅ¿hip, or at leaÅ¿t, not to vÅ¿e his friend Å¿o familiarly as before.</p>
                        <p>But how Å¿hall a man behaue himÅ¿elfe in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e? At the beginning whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he telleth thee thy friends defects, excuÅ¿e them, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the relatour to be ill informed, or that he miÅ¿tooke thy friend; for true friendÅ¿hip requireth, that a friend Å¿hould in all caÅ¿es (when euidently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crary is not conuinced) defend the good name and eÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his friend; and thereby the Å¿ower of diÅ¿Å¿ention, Å¿halbe fruÅ¿trated of his intention.</p>

This inordinat behauiour argueth, firÅ¿t blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and folly; for if you aske them with whom they are offended, they themÅ¿elues cannot Å¿hew you: not with themÅ¿elues, for that were madneÅ¿Å¿e; with the dice? and that were as great follie; with fortune? but that is nothing: therefore wee muÅ¿t conclude, that they (in Å¿uch fits) are fooles, and brawle with the very aire.</p>

                        <p>BeÅ¿ides, theÅ¿e chafing players, play not for recreation, but for gaine; they vÅ¿e company, more for couetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e than for honeÅ¿ty; becauÅ¿e, they would not fret Å¿o much at their looÅ¿ing, if they affected not too much the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and in very deed they abuÅ¿e the nature of play, the which was giuen as a medicine to recreat mens afflicted minds: but theÅ¿e, prepoÅ¿terouÅ¿ly rather afflict the mind, &amp; make it a poiÅ¿on: for they are Å¿o anxious in themÅ¿elues, and many feare Å¿o much to leeÅ¿e, that as Å¿oone as a little Å¿umme is drawne from them, you could hardely diÅ¿cerne whether the heart were more vexed with griefe, or the tongue defiled with oathes. I would truely that in euery common-weale princes Å¿hould puniÅ¿h all perÅ¿ons, that play greater games than their abilitie doth affoord; for I take Å¿uch Å¿orts of exerciÅ¿es to be moÅ¿t pernicious, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaÅ¿ons, to the Å¿tate; and I thinke the puniÅ¿hment mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t for them, Å¿hould be, that it were lawfull to beg them for Wardes, and giue them tutors, becauÅ¿e they lacke diÅ¿cretion to vÅ¿e their money. Rarely you find great play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that carry not proud minds, who if they win, they vaunt of gaine, if they leeÅ¿e, they doe brag of loÅ¿Å¿e: as a Spaniard in a brauado, thought he deÅ¿erued great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, becauÅ¿e hee was able one night to leeÅ¿e ten thouÅ¿and crownes at dice.</p>
                        <p>Others, in play Å¿hew likewiÅ¿e their paÅ¿sions, albeit they exceed not much the lawfull quantity requiÅ¿it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, yet they carry a Å¿ecret pride, &amp; vehement deÅ¿ire to win, becauÅ¿e they would not be inferior to others, euen Å¿o much as in play: wherefore, if any caÅ¿t come croÅ¿Å¿e vnto them, they will chafe as much for a penny, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man for a pound. TheÅ¿e men queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e haue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21840:72"/> Å¿ome little Å¿hrubs of pride and vanitie: for although the moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ure in play conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in the victorie; yet to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it too much, to wrangle, to chafe, to fret therefore, argueth an vnmortified affection, the which wiÅ¿e men ought to ouercome, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch paÅ¿sions are in very deed childiÅ¿h, and vndecent for graue perÅ¿ons.</p>
                        <p>Some men wholly conÅ¿ecrat themÅ¿elues to play, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you Å¿hall haue them at dice, cards, bowles, or Å¿ome Å¿uch game. TheÅ¿e, as vnprofitable members, deÅ¿erue to be cut from the bodie of euery good commonweale; for what wiÅ¿e man would tollerat a Å¿eruant in his houÅ¿e, which did nothing but eat, drinke, and play? They weigh little their Å¿oules, for if they did, doubtleÅ¿Å¿e they would Å¿pend better their time, becauÅ¿e it Å¿eemeth that they were rather created to play than to labour, addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues more to the pleaÅ¿ures of the bodie, than to the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Å¿oule, and moÅ¿t like bruit beaÅ¿ts follow the inordinat appetite of Å¿ence, more than the right rule of reaÅ¿on. TheÅ¿e actions proceed from a Å¿oule altogether depriued of vertue, and repleniÅ¿hed with vice, which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be named brutiÅ¿h than reaÅ¿onable.</p>
                        <p>By this it appeareth, that thoÅ¿e that are addicted much to play, are Å¿enÅ¿uall, chafers in play are couetous, great gameÅ¿ters are fooliÅ¿h: the firÅ¿t getteth baÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ure, the Å¿econd gaineth great vexation, the laÅ¿t winneth pouertie: all Å¿eeme to loue themÅ¿elues; but doubtleÅ¿Å¿e, all hate their Å¿oules: I Å¿ay, they Å¿eeme to loue their bodies, but indeed they are moÅ¿t cruell enemies, for they are butchers which feed their calues for Å¿laughter; they are fiÅ¿hers, who caÅ¿t a golden hooke with a little alluring bait, to catch the fiÅ¿hes for the frying pan; they cheriÅ¿h their bodies with a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21840:73"/> moment of pleaÅ¿ure, after to be puniÅ¿hed with an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of paine. To play too earneÅ¿tly doth argue pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, choller, or follie: to play too careleÅ¿ly, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pany, &amp; carieth Å¿ome Å¿parke of contempt: not to play at all, proceedeth either from extreame holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, grauitie, hypocriÅ¿ie, or inÅ¿enÅ¿ibilitie. Therefore in game vÅ¿e the golden meane, play not too much, nor too Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, nor to great game; take it as medicines, vÅ¿e Å¿ome attention, play for a trifle.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21840:80"/> elÅ¿e from groÅ¿Å¿e ignorance, becauÅ¿e they neither know the nature of mens wits, nor the limits of humane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding: for if we Å¿ee the art of Å¿ayling with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿e, the exerciÅ¿e of Artillerie, the manner of Printing, of late yeeres inuented, augmented, and perfitted; Why may not diuers Sciences already inuented, be increaÅ¿ed with new conceits, amplified with better DemonÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, explaned in a more perÅ¿picuous manner, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a more ordinat method?</p>
                        <p>Contrary to theÅ¿e be certaine itching Å¿pirits, who put euery toy in print, they prize their owne workes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and cenÅ¿ure others iniuriouÅ¿ly: theÅ¿e may well be compared to certaine wild vines, which bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grapes, but neuer mature them: Å¿ome doe it for Å¿ame, and Å¿ome for gaine, and both without diÅ¿cretion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t their owne credit. Therefore great wiÅ¿edome it were, to write Å¿omething diÅ¿creetly, that mens labours may, not onely profit themÅ¿elues, but alÅ¿o be deriued to others: for what doe we account good in it Å¿elfe, if it bee not communicatiue of goodneÅ¿Å¿e, to others? <hi>Bonum eÅ¿t Å¿ui diffuÅ¿inum.</hi> Yet would I haue men not to blab out their conceits without meditation, or good digeÅ¿tion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e, if in all actions it concerneth greatly a mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, to effectuat them with deliberation and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o, much more in writing, which no man haÅ¿teth, being diÅ¿tilled drop by drop from the pen, and of it Å¿elfe permanent, not as words communicatiue to Å¿ome few preÅ¿ent auditors, but blazed to the world, and Å¿ent to all poÅ¿teritie.</p>
                        <p>Some men, in writing, flow with phraÅ¿es, but are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in Å¿ubÅ¿tance of matter, and Å¿uch are neither wittie nor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21840:80"/> wiÅ¿e: others haue good conceits, but deliuered after an affected manner; they put a little liquor into too great a veÅ¿Å¿ell. Others are Å¿o conciÅ¿e, that you need a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to vnderÅ¿tand them; the former be not without all follie, and the latter lacke not Å¿ome pride: yet thoÅ¿e are more commendable than theÅ¿e, for thoÅ¿e onely are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thorow their prolixitie, but theÅ¿e are moleÅ¿tfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they require too great attention, and make a man often Å¿pend many Å¿pirits, to win a Å¿lender knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Many write confuÅ¿edly, without method and order, and Å¿uch comprehend not their matter: others are too preciÅ¿e in diuiÅ¿ions, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, that ere you come to the laÅ¿t part, you haue forgotten the firÅ¿t members: and this defect I find in many poÅ¿tils of Å¿criptures. Good diÅ¿tincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons breed perÅ¿picuitie: but a multitude engendreth obÅ¿cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and beÅ¿t I hold it Å¿o to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h, that diÅ¿tinctions may rather be noted in matter than in words.</p>
                        <p>With this I thinke good to conclude the diÅ¿couery of PaÅ¿sions in humane actions, omitting much more that might bee Å¿aid in this matter; as what paÅ¿sions may bee diÅ¿couered in laughing, in diÅ¿puting, in croÅ¿sing, in nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating, and Å¿uch like externall operations: and eÅ¿pecially two diÅ¿courÅ¿es I haue omitted, or rather not printed though penned; the one is a diÅ¿couerie of paÅ¿sions in cenÅ¿uring bookes, a matter not vnneceÅ¿Å¿arie for this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall age, wherein euery mans labours are araigned at the tribunall Å¿eat of euery pedanticall cenÅ¿urious <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchs</hi> vnderÅ¿tanding.

                        <p>2 DIuines and PhiloÅ¿ophers commonly affirme, that all other paÅ¿sions acknowledge loue to be their fountaine, root, and mother; the reaÅ¿on I take to be for that al paÅ¿sions, either proÅ¿ecut Å¿ome good, or flie Å¿ome euill: thoÅ¿e which flie euill, as hatred, feare, Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, preÅ¿uppoÅ¿e the loue of Å¿ome good, the which that euill depriueth, as for example; who hateth death, but he which loueth life? who feareth aduerÅ¿ity, but he that loueth proÅ¿peritie? who is penÅ¿iue in his Å¿ickeneÅ¿Å¿e, but hee that loueth health? Loue then goeth before all thoÅ¿e paÅ¿sions which eÅ¿chew euil. AmongÅ¿t them which proÅ¿ecute good, loue likewiÅ¿e proceedeth, for the paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions of our minds are not vnlike the motions of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For as things naturally mooued, haue an appetite or naturall inclination to the place whereunto they are mooued, mooue, and reÅ¿t therein; as the water which runneth Å¿o faÅ¿t downe the mountaines, hath an inÅ¿tinct of Nature to be vnited with the Sea, for which cauÅ¿e we Å¿ee brookes and flouds runne with Å¿uch a maine force to attaine thereunto, when they come to the Sea; preÅ¿ently they ioyne in friendÅ¿hip, and liue in concord, ioyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as louing friends: euen Å¿o, we Å¿ee in beaÅ¿tes, the horÅ¿e loueth water when hee is thirÅ¿tie, and therefore by deÅ¿ire hee Å¿eeketh out Å¿ome riuer or fountaine; when he hath found it, he drinketh, pleaÅ¿eth himÅ¿elf therewith, and Å¿o reÅ¿teth contented. This ordinarie courÅ¿e keepe paÅ¿sions: but Å¿ometimes this Å¿ubordination is changed, for if a man bee wounded, vpon a Å¿odaine, the preÅ¿ent

And the reaÅ¿on of this enlarged and extenÅ¿iue affection in paÅ¿sions, I thinke proceedeth from the very heart and nature of euery paÅ¿sion: For when we loue God, our parents, or friends, we are well pleaÅ¿ed and contented with all thoÅ¿e treaÅ¿ures of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21840:86"/> honeÅ¿tie, wealth and all other perfections they haue, and wiÅ¿h them Å¿uch as beÅ¿eeme them, which they want; and this we deÅ¿ire to Å¿ee performed, and reioyce when it is accompliÅ¿hed: and therefore Å¿ince that a man hath many good things of nature, as children, wife, kinÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, &amp;c. and many additions by fortune, as Å¿eruants, horÅ¿es, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿sions, &amp;c. and many priÅ¿ed ornaments, as credit, glorie, fame, images, Å¿tatues, &amp;c. and diuers other things which haue reference and relation vnto him as their maÅ¿ter, lord, and owner: and therefore he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth intirely his friend, loueth all that belongeth vnto his friend, and valueth them at that rate it deÅ¿erueth and his friend priÅ¿eth them.

                     <p>Out of this diÅ¿courÅ¿e we may collect Å¿ome practicall points very profitable, and know a reaÅ¿on how men commonly carrie themÅ¿elues towards appaÅ¿sionat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons. FirÅ¿t, for that we Å¿ay Å¿ight Å¿tirreth vp paÅ¿sions, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21840:87"/> not onely the perÅ¿ons we loue, but alÅ¿o whatÅ¿oeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaÅ¿eth any thing of them. Therefore generally among friends which be abÅ¿ent and out of Å¿ight, affections are colder and rarer: for although true friends haue alwayes a Å¿ecret cabinet in their memories to talke in their minds with them whom they loue, although abÅ¿ent; yet except the memorie be reuiued by Å¿ome externall obiect, obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entreth, thoughts are more remiÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; friendÅ¿hip fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: Wherefore, meÅ¿Å¿ages, letters, tokens, friends, kinÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, and Å¿uch things as concerne vs, are to bee Å¿ent to our friends to renouat and reuiue our former amitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we would not exaÅ¿perat our enemies, it were expedient not onely we our Å¿elues, but alÅ¿o all theÅ¿e things which any way belong vs, appeare not in their Å¿ights: yea, and that is more, we muÅ¿t take heed as much as in vs lieth, that they vnderÅ¿tand not any proÅ¿peritie or good befallen vnto vs: becauÅ¿e in all theÅ¿e Å¿ights ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is Å¿tirred vp and reuiued anew, which lay Å¿mothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before vnder the embers of forgetfulneÅ¿Å¿e: and Å¿o with Å¿ilence perhaps enmitie of it Å¿elfe will conÅ¿ume and pine away.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to perÅ¿uade any matter we intend, or to Å¿tirre vp any paÅ¿sion in a multitude, if we can aptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our opinion or intention with any viÅ¿ible obiect, no doubt but the perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion would bee more forcible, and the paÅ¿sion more potent. <hi>Cato</hi> was determined to Å¿trike the Senat and Romanes, with feare of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian forces; &amp; leaÅ¿t they Å¿hould obiect againÅ¿t him, that Carthage was farre from them, and therefore not Å¿o dangerous, he preÅ¿ently Å¿hewed them greene figges, at that inÅ¿tant brought from Carthage; &amp; Å¿o they all concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                     <p>Among the Iewes the arke of God as a viÅ¿ible Å¿igne was borne by the Leuits in the battell, as with a preÅ¿ent obiect to deliuer them from all feare of enemies, thereby conceiuing the infallible aÅ¿siÅ¿tauce and protection of God ouer them, whoÅ¿e cauÅ¿e they handled and defended.

                     <p>LaÅ¿t of all it ought Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to be conÅ¿idered, that the preÅ¿ence of any viÅ¿ible obiect, moueth much more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently. the paÅ¿sion, than the imagination or conceit thereof in the abÅ¿ence: for the imagination in abÅ¿ence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿enteth the pleaÅ¿ure as farre off and not prepared; but the thing being preÅ¿ent, nothing Å¿eemeth to want but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.

The Spaniards play their Zarabanda vpon the Gittern, which moueth them (as I heare reported) to daunce, and doe worÅ¿e. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> once chaunced to fall into the<note place="margin">BaÅ¿il. hom. de legen lib.

                     <p>The deuill being a Å¿pirit, cannot be expelled from a bodie naturally by the vertue of muÅ¿icke, but as we may conceiue and inferre out of the Å¿criptures, either <hi>Saul</hi> was really poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by the deuill, and then not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:21840:89"/> forces of <hi>Dauids</hi> Å¿ongs and Å¿ounds, but the aÅ¿siÅ¿tance of God and his help expelled the deuill, at what time <hi>Dauid</hi> Å¿ung his Å¿acred hymnes. Or the deuill was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Saul,</hi> but onely moleÅ¿ted him with the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Å¿ome melancholy humour, as the falling Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or Å¿ome other Å¿ort of melancholy madneÅ¿Å¿e: and then as this peruerÅ¿e malignant humour cauÅ¿eth feares, Å¿ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿uch like melancholy paÅ¿sions; Å¿o muÅ¿icke cauÅ¿eth mirth, ioy, and delight, the which abate, expell, and quite deÅ¿troy their contrary affections, and withall, rectifie the blood and Å¿pirits, and conÅ¿equently diÅ¿geÅ¿t melancholy, and bring the body into a good temper. Whether of theÅ¿e two was in <hi>Saul,</hi> Diuines doubt, and PhyÅ¿itians are not able to reÅ¿olue. ReaÅ¿ons may bee brought for both parts; Å¿ome Diuines attribute it to God, Å¿ome PhyÅ¿itians aÅ¿cribe the cure to the naturall vertue of muÅ¿icke. The reaÅ¿on for the PhyÅ¿itians, is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the text; for it Å¿eemeth that the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e or wicked Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed <hi>Saul</hi> was a thing vÅ¿uall in the countrey, becauÅ¿e his Å¿eruants councelled him to procure a muÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, to the intent that when his maladie moleÅ¿ted him, the muÅ¿icke might comfort him. It neuer was vÅ¿uall in any countrey, nor in all the Å¿cripture practiÅ¿ed to caÅ¿t out deuils by the playing vpon inÅ¿truments: therefore it was a melancholie humour, by the deuill introducted, and by muÅ¿icke cauÅ¿ing mirth expelled.</p>
                     <p>The Diuines haue a more Å¿olid argument for their opinion, becauÅ¿e the Å¿criptures ought to be vnderÅ¿tood in their proper Å¿ence as the words Å¿ound, when no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urditie neceÅ¿Å¿arily thereupon enÅ¿ueth, as in this expoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is euident; for, aÅ¿cribing it to God what abÅ¿urditie can

                     <p>Againe I would gladly know when theÅ¿e PhyÅ¿itians euer Å¿ee with a fit of mirth either theÅ¿e melancholy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es notoriouÅ¿ly remitted, or when the paroxime was vpon them quite taken away, let it bee either Lycan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropia, that is, a woolfiÅ¿h madneÅ¿Å¿e; or EpilepÅ¿ia the falling Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e? if they could Å¿hew me Å¿uch a minÅ¿trell, I doubt not but in Å¿hort time he would be able to buy all the PhyÅ¿itians that dwell within an hundred miles of him. For the Å¿cripture Å¿aith expreÅ¿ly, <hi>Dauid tollebat &amp; percutiebat manu Å¿ua &amp; refocillabatur Saul &amp; leuius habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, recedebat enim ab eo Å¿piritus malus,</hi> If the deuill perÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally had not afflicted him, the humour had ceaÅ¿ed from moleÅ¿tation but not departed away: and the Å¿cripture yeeldeth a reaÅ¿on (as appeareth by the word <hi>enim</hi>) why he was comforted, becauÅ¿e the deuill was gone away.</p>
                     <p>The argument which I obiected in fauour of the PhyÅ¿itians may bee anÅ¿wered two wayes: firÅ¿t, that the Å¿eruants of <hi>Saul</hi> no otherwiÅ¿e intended to cure his diÅ¿eaÅ¿e by muÅ¿icke, than commonly in the maladies or vexation of great perÅ¿onages, their friends procure muÅ¿ick to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them; whence from Å¿oeuer the maladies proceed, they neither know, nor generally regard.

It is not Å¿o great a meruaile, that meat, drinke, exerciÅ¿e, and aire Å¿et paÅ¿sions aloft, for theÅ¿e are diuers waies qualified, and conÅ¿equently apt to Å¿tirre vp humors; but what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie carie Å¿imple Å¿ingle Å¿ounds and voices, to enable them to worke Å¿uch wonders?</p>
                     <p>I had rather in this point read Å¿ome learned diÅ¿courÅ¿e, than deliuer mine opinion: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, in Å¿uch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truÅ¿e difficultie, he that Å¿peaketh moÅ¿t apparently and probably, Å¿aith the beÅ¿t: and therefore I will Å¿et downe thoÅ¿e formes or manners of motion which occurre to my mind and Å¿eeme likelieÅ¿t.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t is a certaine Å¿ympathie, correÅ¿pondence, or proportion betwixt our Å¿oules and muÅ¿ick: and no other cauÅ¿e can be yeelded. Who can giue any other reaÅ¿on, why the loadÅ¿tone draweth yron, but a Å¿ympathie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21840:93"/> Why the Needle, toucht but with Å¿uch a Å¿tone, Å¿hould neuer leaue looking towards the North Pole; who can render other reaÅ¿on, than Å¿ympathie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If we make a Å¿uruey of all birds of the aire, fiÅ¿hes of the Å¿ea, beaÅ¿ts of the land, we Å¿hall find euery Å¿ort affect a proper kind of food: a lyon will eat no hay, nor a bull beefe; a horÅ¿e eateth bread, and a leopard abhorreth it: a kite liueth vpon carrion, and a hen cannot endure it: if a man Å¿hould beat his braine to find out the reaÅ¿on, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be giuen, than Å¿ympathie of nature. So we may Å¿ay, that Å¿uch is the nature of our Å¿oules, as muÅ¿icke hath a certaine proportionat Å¿ympathie with them: as our taÅ¿ts haue with Å¿uch varieties of daintie cates, our Å¿mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Å¿uch varietie of odours, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd manner of this miracle in nature, Å¿ome aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign and aÅ¿cribe to Gods generall prouidence, who when theÅ¿e Å¿ounds affect the eare, produceth a certaine Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all qualitie in the Å¿oule, the which Å¿tirreth vp one or other paÅ¿sion, according to the varietie of voices, or conÅ¿orts of inÅ¿truments. Neither this is to be meruailed at, for the very Å¿ame vpon neceÅ¿sitie we muÅ¿t put in the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which not being able to dart the formes of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which are materiall; into the vnderÅ¿tanding, which is Å¿pirituall, therefore where nature wanteth, Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Å¿upplieth. So corporall muÅ¿icke being vnable to worke Å¿uch extraordinarie effects in our Å¿oules, God by his ordinarie naturall prouidence produceth them. The like we may Å¿ay of the creation of our Å¿oules; for men being able to produce the bodie, but vnable to create the Å¿oule, man prepareth the matter, and God createth the forme: Å¿o in muÅ¿icke, men Å¿ound and heare, God Å¿triketh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21840:94"/> vpon, and Å¿tirreth vp the heart.</p>
                     <p>The third maner more Å¿enÅ¿ible &amp; palpable is this, that the very Å¿ound it Å¿elfe, which according to the beÅ¿t phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophie, is nothing elÅ¿e but a certaine artificiall Å¿haking, criÅ¿pling, or tickling of the ayre (like as we Å¿ee in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter criÅ¿pled, when it is calme, and a Å¿weet gale of wind ruffleth it a little; or when wee caÅ¿t a Å¿tone into a calme water, we may perceiue diuers warbling naturall circles) which paÅ¿Å¿eth thorow the eares, and by them vnto the heart, and there beateth and tickleth it in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as it is moued with Å¿emblable paÅ¿sions. For as the heart is moÅ¿t delicat and Å¿enÅ¿atiue, Å¿o it perceiueth the leaÅ¿t motions and impreÅ¿sions that may be: and it Å¿eemeth that muÅ¿icke in thoÅ¿e celles playeth with the vitall and animate Å¿pirits, the onely inÅ¿truments and Å¿purres of paÅ¿sions. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we perceiue by a little tickling of our Å¿ides, or the Å¿oles of our feet, how we are mooued to laughter, yea and the very heart Å¿trings Å¿eeme in Å¿ome Å¿ort to be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this almoÅ¿t Å¿enceleÅ¿Å¿e motion. And in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, we may bring two apt coniectures: The firÅ¿t is, in our own hands or face, the which if we Å¿mooth, tickle, preÅ¿Å¿e downe, nip, heat, or coole, wee perceiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Å¿orts &amp; diuerÅ¿ities of Å¿enÅ¿ations, and feele our Å¿elues Å¿undry wayes affected: if Å¿uch varieties we find in a thicke skin, how much more in a tender heart, farre more apter to feele than any member elÅ¿e of our bodie. The Å¿econd coniecture is, the filing of iron, and Å¿craping of trenchers, which many naturally (yea and almoÅ¿t all men before they be accuÅ¿tomed vnto them) abhorre to heare, not only becauÅ¿e they are vngratefull to the eare, but alÅ¿o for that the aire Å¿o carued, puniÅ¿heth and fretteth the heart.</p>

                     <p>The laÅ¿t and beÅ¿t manner I take to be, that as all other Å¿ences haue an admirable multiplicitie of obiects which delight them, Å¿o hath the eare: and as it is impoÅ¿sible to expound the varietie of delights, or diÅ¿guÅ¿tes, which we perceiue by them, and receiue in them (for who can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿h the delights wee take in eating fiÅ¿h, fleÅ¿h, fruit, Å¿o many thouÅ¿and Å¿auces, and commixtions of Å¿pices with fiÅ¿h, fleÅ¿h, and fruit?) Å¿o in muÅ¿icke, diuers conÅ¿orts Å¿tirre vp in the heart, diuers Å¿orts of ioyes, and diuers Å¿orts of Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e or paine: the which as men are affected, may be diuerÅ¿ly applied: Let a good and a Godly man heare muÅ¿icke, and hee will lift vp his heart to heauen: let a bad man heare the Å¿ame, and hee will conuert it to luÅ¿t: Let a Å¿ouldiour heare a trumpet or a drum, and his bloud will boile and bend to battell; let a clowne heare the Å¿ame, and he will fall a dauncing; let the common people heare the like, and they wil fall a gazing, or laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and many neuer regard them, eÅ¿pecially if they bee accuÅ¿tomed to heare them. So that in this, mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and diÅ¿poÅ¿itions, by meanes of muÅ¿icke, may Å¿tir vp diuers paÅ¿sions, as in Å¿eeing we daily prooue the like. True it is, that one kind of muÅ¿icke may be more apt to one paÅ¿sion than another, as alÅ¿o one obiect of Å¿ight is more proportionat to Å¿tirre vp loue, hatred, or pleaÅ¿ure, or Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, than another.

Therefore if we intend to imprint a paÅ¿sion in another, it is requiÅ¿it firÅ¿t it be Å¿tamped in our hearts: for thorow our voices, eyes, and geÅ¿tures, the world will pierce and thorowly perceiue how we are affected. And for this cauÅ¿e the paÅ¿sion which is in our breÅ¿t muÅ¿t be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and origen of all externall actions; and as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall affection is more vehement, Å¿o the externall perÅ¿ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion will be more potent: for the paÅ¿sion in the perÅ¿uader Å¿eemeth to mee, to reÅ¿emble the wind a trumpeter blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in at one end of the trumpet, and in what manner it proceedeth from him, Å¿o it iÅ¿Å¿ueth forth at the other end, and commeth to our eares; euen Å¿o the paÅ¿sion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the heart, and is blowne about the bodie, face, eies, hands, voice, and Å¿o by geÅ¿tures paÅ¿Å¿eth into our eyes, and by Å¿ounds into our eares: and as it is qualified, Å¿o it worketh in vs. But I know Å¿ome would vnderÅ¿tand the cauÅ¿e, why a good reaÅ¿on in the preacher or oratour will not Å¿uffice to perÅ¿uade the people, vnleÅ¿Å¿e they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues be affected with the like paÅ¿sion? I anÅ¿were, that wiÅ¿e men are moÅ¿t moued with Å¿ound reaÅ¿ons, and leÅ¿Å¿e with paÅ¿sions: contrariwiÅ¿e the common people or men not of deepe iudgement, are more perÅ¿uaded with paÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Å¿peakers; the reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e as we haue two Å¿ences of diÅ¿cipline eÅ¿pecially, the eyes &amp; the eares: reaÅ¿on entreth the eates; the paÅ¿sion wherewith the oratour is affected paÅ¿Å¿eth by the eyes, for in his face we diÅ¿couer it, and in other geÅ¿tures: the eyes are more certaine meÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and leÅ¿Å¿e to be doubted of, for we many times Å¿uÅ¿pect
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21840:97"/> the reaÅ¿ons leaÅ¿t they be friuolous, although we cannot anÅ¿were them; but thoÅ¿e paÅ¿sions we Å¿ee, nature imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them deeper in our hearts, and for moÅ¿t part they Å¿eeme Å¿o euident, as they admit no tergiuerÅ¿ation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the euidence and certaintie of the paÅ¿sion, perÅ¿ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much more effectually the common people, than a Å¿uÅ¿pected reaÅ¿on: and the Å¿uÅ¿pition of Å¿ophiÅ¿tication is much more encreaÅ¿ed when wee Å¿ee it not worke that effect in the teacher which he would Å¿tirre vp in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Againe, vÅ¿ually men are more moued with deeds than words, reaÅ¿onable perÅ¿uations reÅ¿emble words, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall paÅ¿sions are compared to deeds. Furthermore the paÅ¿sion paÅ¿Å¿eth not onely thorow the eyes, but alÅ¿o pierceth the eare, and thereby the heart; for a flexible and pliable voice, accommodated in manner correÅ¿pondent to the matter whereof a perÅ¿on intreateth, conueyeth the paÅ¿sion moÅ¿t aptly, pathetically, and almoÅ¿t harmonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and euery accent, exclamation, admiration, increpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, indignation, commiÅ¿eration, abhomination, exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, exultation, fitly (that is diÅ¿tinctly, at time and place, with geÅ¿ture correÅ¿pondent, and flexibilitie of voice proportionat) deliuered, is either a flaÅ¿h of fire to incenÅ¿e a paÅ¿sion, or a baÅ¿on of water to quench a paÅ¿sion incenÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>A man therefore furniÅ¿hed himÅ¿elfe with the paÅ¿sion or affection he wiÅ¿heth in his auditors, Å¿hewing it with voice and action, although his reaÅ¿ons be not Å¿o potent, hath no doubt a moÅ¿t potent meane to perÅ¿uade what he liÅ¿t. Wherefore <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes,</hi> as of all Oratours the prince for action, Å¿o he defined, that the principall part of<note place="margin">Cicero in Brut.</note> an Oration was action; the Å¿econd, the Å¿ame; the third, no
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21840:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> other than action. <hi>IÅ¿ocrates,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e called the father of eloquence, for lacke of a good voice neuer pleaded publickely. <hi>Cicero</hi> Å¿aith, Å¿ome were <hi>viri diÅ¿erti,</hi> that is, very eloquent, but for lack of action or rather vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>habiti Å¿unt infantes,</hi> they were accounted infants: and I haue Å¿eene Å¿ome preachers very meane Å¿chollers, and in truth otherwiÅ¿e but Å¿illie men, yet for that they excelled in action, all the world followed them. For acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is either a certaine viÅ¿ible eloquence, or an eloquence of the bodie, or a comely grace in deliuering conceits, or an externall image of an internall mind, or a Å¿haddow of affections, or three Å¿prings which flow from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, called <hi>vox, vultus, vita,</hi> voice, countenance, life, that is, the affection poureth forth it Å¿elfe by all meanes poÅ¿sible, to diÅ¿couer vnto the preÅ¿ent beholders and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, how the actor is affected, and what affection Å¿uch a caÅ¿e and cauÅ¿e requireth in them: by mouth he telleth his mind; in countenance he Å¿peaketh with a Å¿ilent voice to the eyes; with all the vniuerÅ¿all life and bodie he Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to Å¿ay, Thus we moue, becauÅ¿e by the paÅ¿sion thus we are mooued, and as it hath wrought in vs Å¿o it ought to worke in you. Action then vniuerÅ¿ally is a naturall or artificiall moderation, qualification, modification, or compoÅ¿ition of the voice, countenance, and geÅ¿ture of bodie proceeding from Å¿ome paÅ¿sion, and apt to Å¿tirre vp the like: for it Å¿eemeth, that the Å¿oule playeth vpon theÅ¿e three parts, as a muÅ¿ition vpon three Å¿trings, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Å¿triking Å¿o they Å¿ound.</p>
                     <p>A number of precepts Oratours preÅ¿cribe about theÅ¿e three parts, and labour extreamly by art to perfit and accompliÅ¿h the rude indigeÅ¿ted motions of nature: to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21840:98"/> them therefore I will leaue the minching of this matter in particularities, and onely Å¿et downe certaine genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, although art Å¿upplie the defects of nature, yet if a man haue not a good naturall habilitie, it is impoÅ¿si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by art to come to any perfection for this manner of motion. The reaÅ¿on hereof is manifeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e as in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ick, he that wanteth a tunable voice by nature, although he otherwiÅ¿e excell in the art of muÅ¿icke, yet it were leÅ¿Å¿e paine to heare him Å¿ay than Å¿ing. And I haue knowne moÅ¿t exquiÅ¿it muÅ¿itians vnable to Å¿ing aptly fiue notes: Å¿o in action, he that wanteth a good voice, a good nimble eye, a proportionat bodie, and other parts naturall, may Å¿peak with reaÅ¿on, but neuer almoÅ¿t aptly for perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion: indeed if the habilities of nature be not very vntoward, art may correct many defects of nature: as <hi>DemoÅ¿thenes</hi> had a little liÅ¿ping at firÅ¿t, but by labour and diligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. <hi>IÅ¿ocrates</hi> impediments were incorrigible, and therefore all his labour had been loÅ¿t, if he had emploied himÅ¿elfe to acting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he that will act well, muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿sitie Å¿tir vp firÅ¿t that affect in himÅ¿elfe, he intendeth to imprint in the hearts of his hearers; and the more vehement the paÅ¿sion is, the more excellent action is like to enÅ¿ue. The reaÅ¿on is, for, as I Å¿aid aboue, the voice, eyes, and geÅ¿tures Å¿ound without, as the heart Å¿triketh within: and therfore the vehementer paÅ¿sion venteth forth, the liuelier action. Yet here muÅ¿t one or two cautions be conÅ¿idered: FirÅ¿t in ire and indignation, that the paÅ¿sion and action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liÅ¿h not of Å¿ome priuat quarell or reuenge; for then it leeÅ¿eth all the force and grace of perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion, becauÅ¿e the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21840:99"/> paÅ¿sion Å¿melleth then of proper intereÅ¿t and vtilitie, and conÅ¿equently will be accounted inordinate and vitious. Secondly in feare and Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, that they render not the actions vile and abiect: for then the paÅ¿sion will rather be occaÅ¿ion or cauÅ¿e to Å¿mother and kill them, than to reuiue and animate them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, euery part of action ought to expreÅ¿Å¿e the mind as grauely, as prudently, as Å¿olidly as may be: The reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e he that publickely intendeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uade, muÅ¿t be eÅ¿teemed a wiÅ¿e, and a good man; wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muÅ¿t make the auditors beleeue he erreth not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ignorance, honeÅ¿tie muÅ¿t induce them to thinke hee will not lie: therefore all his actions ought to be prudent and graue: for if they be any way light or raÅ¿h, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently he will be Å¿uÅ¿pected, either not to haue premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted maturely his matter, or not to regard what he Å¿aith, or not to be Å¿o Å¿etled in vertue and knowledge as Å¿uch an important matter requireth: for leuitie and raÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e, at leaÅ¿t argue imprudence, inconÅ¿ideration, immortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and precipitation, which all are capitall enemies to deepe conÅ¿ulation, Å¿pecially in matters which concerne perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion to vertue, or diÅ¿Å¿uaÅ¿ion from vice, exhortation to goodneÅ¿Å¿e, or dehortation from ilneÅ¿Å¿e. Wherefore in action all leuitie muÅ¿t be auoided: In voyce, that the words be not pronounced too faÅ¿t, nor any light or Å¿curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous word enter in: In face, that the eye range not abroad vagabond like, nor be toÅ¿Å¿ed or turned too lightly; that the oratour make no faces, writhing of mouth, wrinkling of noÅ¿e, or too much Å¿haking of head: IngeÅ¿ture, no tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with fingers, quickly wreÅ¿ting of the bodie, light go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or much geÅ¿ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:21840:99"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, he ought to endeuour, that euery part of action immitate as liuely as may be the nature of the paÅ¿sion: <hi>Sextus PhiloÅ¿ophus</hi> Å¿aid our bodie was <hi>imago ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> becauÅ¿e the maners of the Å¿oule followed the temper of the body, and therfore he that knew perfitly this, could not be ignorant of that: Å¿o the actions of the bodie Å¿hold be, in a perfit perÅ¿uader, an image of the paÅ¿sion in the mind. But how Å¿hal this be performed? Two general rules at this preÅ¿ent occurre vnto my memorie, not very hard to be learned, but exceeding profitable to be practiÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t is, that we looke vpon other men appaÅ¿sio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, how they demeane themÅ¿elues in paÅ¿sions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erue what and how they Å¿peake in mirth, Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, ire, feare, hope, &amp;c. what motions are Å¿tirring in the eyes, hands, bodie, &amp;c. And then leaue the exceÅ¿Å¿e and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant leuitie or other defects, and keepe the manner corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with prudent mediocritie: and this the beÅ¿t may be marked in Å¿tage plaiers, who act excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly; for as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their exerciÅ¿e conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in imitation of others, Å¿o they that imitate beÅ¿t, act beÅ¿t. And in the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of externall action for moÅ¿t part oratours and Å¿tageplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers agree: and onely they differ in this, that theÅ¿e act fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, thoÅ¿e really; theÅ¿e onely to delight, thoÅ¿e to Å¿tirre vp all Å¿orts of paÅ¿sions according to the exigencie of the matter; theÅ¿e intermingle much leuitie in their action to<note place="margin">Cicer lib. 3. de Orat.</note> make men laugh, thoÅ¿e vÅ¿e all grauitie, grace, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to perÅ¿uade: wherefore theÅ¿e are accounted redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, thoÅ¿e eÅ¿teemed prudent. But a diÅ¿creet oratour may Å¿ee in them what he may amend, and what he may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. If there were an excellent preacher, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable not onely for doctrine, but alÅ¿o for action, hee
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21840:100"/> would Å¿erue as a glaÅ¿Å¿e for euery oratour to behold the beautie or blots of his action.</p>
                     <p>Secondly loue, deÅ¿ire, and ioy, require a plaine, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant, Å¿oft, mild, gentle voice, and the like countenance: true it is that a diÅ¿courÅ¿e Å¿ermon or oration being wouen with various periods, and compounded of Å¿undry parts, generally cannot be Å¿aid to admit one onely Å¿ort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation, action, or geÅ¿ture: becauÅ¿e although wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for example to induce our auditors to loue God, to obey their prince, &amp;c. yet reaÅ¿on requireth, and art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribeth, that our probations be often grounded vpon contraries, incommodities, diÅ¿graces, puniÅ¿hments, and diuers inconueniences, which would enÅ¿ue vpon the want and defect thereof: and therefore in euery part and period, the nature and qualitie of the affection, muÅ¿t rule and moderat the voyce and action.</p>
                     <p>Hatred and ire exact a vehement voice, and much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture a pronuntiation Å¿harpe, often falling with patheticall repetitions, iterated interrogations, prouing, confirming, and vrging reaÅ¿ons: the manner of this action wee may beÅ¿t diÅ¿couer in wittie women when they chide; becauÅ¿e although their exceÅ¿Å¿e be vitious and not to be imitated, yet for that they let nature worke in her kind, their furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faÅ¿hion will Å¿erue for a good meane to perceiue the externall manage of this paÅ¿sion. Their voyce is loud and Å¿harpe, and conÅ¿equently apt to cut, which is proper to ire and hatred, which wiÅ¿h ill, and intend reuenge: their geÅ¿tures are frequent, their faces inflamed, their eyes glowing, their reaÅ¿ons hurry one in the necke of another, they with their fingers number the wrongs offered them, the harmes, iniuries, diÅ¿graces, and what not, thought
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21840:100"/> Å¿ayd, and done againÅ¿t them: if a prudent oratour could in this caÅ¿e batter their matter, circumciÅ¿e the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of the reaÅ¿on, abate the exceÅ¿Å¿e of their furie, certainely he might win a pretie forme for framing his action.</p>
                     <p>In Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e and commiÅ¿eration, a graue, doleful, plaine voyce is beÅ¿t, without much varietie either of eye, face, or hand, for the orator muÅ¿t Å¿hew himÅ¿elfe in Å¿oule and hart afflicted, oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, halfe dead; and therefore no more life ought to appeare without externall eyes and eares, than is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to deliuer the force of our reaÅ¿ons, and the griefe of our minds: our proofes may bee vrged and proÅ¿ecuted but alwayes with a pitifull weeping eye and a fainting lamentable tune: yet notwithÅ¿tanding, the voyce Å¿ometimes ought to bee interrupted with wofull exclamations and ruthfull repetitions, with alas, woe is me, &amp;c. The eye alÅ¿o may be grauely eleuated vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or abiected to earth, but it muÅ¿t be done Å¿eldome and merueilous Å¿oberly.</p>
                     <p>As feare participateth of hatred and Å¿adneÅ¿Å¿e, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿ting an imminent euill, and Å¿orrowing leaÅ¿t it befall, and therefore requireth like voyce, countenance and action; Å¿o, becauÅ¿e little it would auaile to explaine the perill and daunger thereof, except we encouraged and Å¿tirred vp our hearers to attempt meanes, to proÅ¿ecute labours, to enterpriÅ¿e difficulties, to encounter and reÅ¿iÅ¿t the euill: therefore according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> inÅ¿truction, we muÅ¿t <hi>arguere, obÅ¿ecrare, increpare,</hi> accuÅ¿e, requeÅ¿t, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. The example we may haue in the paÅ¿sion of a man, whoÅ¿e next neighbours houÅ¿e being Å¿et a fire, if he Å¿hould firÅ¿t of all diÅ¿couer it and perceiue that verÅ¿e like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be verified in him.</p>

                     <p>AS reaÅ¿on concerneth the principall part of man, Å¿o reaÅ¿on Å¿pecially Å¿hould Å¿tirre vp, or Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e the affections of man. But becauÅ¿e moÅ¿t men, though reaÅ¿onable by nature, yet declare themÅ¿elues moÅ¿t vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable, if not bruitiÅ¿h, by action, following rather the allurement of Å¿ences, than obeying the perÅ¿uaÅ¿ions of prudence; therefore this meane muÅ¿t either be handled very artificially, or elÅ¿e all our endeuours will be but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21840:103"/> loÅ¿t, for if we intend to perÅ¿uade them by profound reaÅ¿ons, who either vnderÅ¿tand them not at all, or elÅ¿e ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Å¿uperficially, wee Å¿hall moone them to loath our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, and thereupon diÅ¿like and perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our cauÅ¿e. Wherefore the paÅ¿sion mouer muÅ¿t looke narrowly to this point, &amp; imitate herein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiÅ¿e of prudent PhyÅ¿itians, who apply their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin to the Å¿ame maladies with particular reÅ¿pect and conÅ¿ideration of the patients temper, and Å¿o to a little child they will not giue the like purgation they would to a Å¿trong man, nor to a delicate ladie, though affected with the Å¿ame ague, which to a Å¿teelie Å¿tomackt boore of the countrie. In like maner, common people and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found doctors, are not to be perÅ¿uaded with the Å¿ame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for popular perÅ¿uaÅ¿ions theÅ¿e prize not, &amp; deepe demonÅ¿trations they pierce not. How to fail right vpon both, &amp; not decline to either extreame in perÅ¿uading the one part Å¿euerally, requireth great prudence, and a Å¿ound iudgement. Yet I thinke there may be found out a mean to propound &amp; deliuer deepe reaÅ¿ons perÅ¿picuouÅ¿ly, and plauÅ¿ible perÅ¿uaÅ¿ions Å¿harply, Å¿o that the plainneÅ¿Å¿e of the one will make them plauÅ¿ible, and the acuteneÅ¿Å¿e in the other will allay their flaÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e and render them pleaÅ¿ant.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t of all it is to be noted, that not euery kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on hath force to Å¿tirre vp a paÅ¿sion, but an vrgent and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, either really or at leaÅ¿t in conceit: this wee prooue by experience, for common and ordinarie motiues moue vs not much to loue or like a thing: wherefore God to induce the IÅ¿raelits to wiÅ¿h and deÅ¿ire the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e, deÅ¿cribed it as a countrey Å¿lowing with milke
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21840:103"/> and honie, &amp;c. and commonly euery one who would perÅ¿uade vs to loue or affect any thing, highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it; or contrariwiÅ¿e if a man would haue vs to hate and deteÅ¿t any thing, he endeuoureth as much as may be to make apparent the exceÅ¿Å¿e of the euil or great damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it apporteth. PaÅ¿sions then muÅ¿t be moued with vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaÅ¿ons, reaÅ¿ons vrging proceed from Å¿olid amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, amplifications are gathered from common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, common places fit for oratoricall perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a part of Rhethoricke called Inuention. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were requiÅ¿it for an excellentÅ¿tir-paÅ¿sion to haue in a readineÅ¿Å¿e all thoÅ¿e places which oratours aÅ¿signe, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their arcinall or Å¿torehouÅ¿e of perÅ¿uaÅ¿iue prouiÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will briefly inÅ¿inuat them, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the reader and practiÅ¿er of this point a Å¿choller both in Rethoricke and PhiloÅ¿ophie, for otherwiÅ¿e he Å¿hall receiue Å¿mall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hereby, and onely I will deliuer him a Å¿hort plaine perÅ¿picuous method how to call to memory theÅ¿e places; that by them, not onely in this matter of paÅ¿sions but in all diÅ¿courÅ¿es, he may be enabled preÅ¿ently almoÅ¿t in a glaunce to Å¿uruey, and comprehend all arguments and reaÅ¿ons which occurre in his preÅ¿ent affaire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a philoÅ¿opher cannot be ignorant of the foure firÅ¿t queÅ¿tions, which in the poÅ¿teriors he is taught to demaund of euery Å¿ubiect. <hi>Quid nominis, Quid rei, Qualis Å¿it, Propter quid Å¿it.</hi> The name of the thing, the nature of the thing, the proprieties and accidents inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the thing, the finall and efficient cauÅ¿es of the thing.

But for that I perceiued in my Å¿elfe, that a multitude of places, without a forme of method, engendered rather confuÅ¿ion than furthered inuention, therefore I haue Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them into heads: becauÅ¿e the nature of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is Å¿uch, that if it conceiue but an inckling of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, preÅ¿ently by the force of diÅ¿courÅ¿e, our vnderÅ¿tanding followeth it: and now hauing all places reduced to foure heads, he had a bad memory could not remember them, and a worÅ¿e wit which could not draw forth a number of arguments out of them. I cannot denie but pregnant Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and eleuated iudgements in a moment, almoÅ¿t, pierce their matter, and behold before their eyes a number of Å¿ound and Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall reaÅ¿ons, which enuiron the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion propoÅ¿ed on euery Å¿ide; but theÅ¿e be few and rare, others need more helpe: and yet euen theÅ¿e alÅ¿o may be greatly furthered, for the beÅ¿t places which conÅ¿ort with common peoples capacities, are for moÅ¿t part out of learned mens bookes; as Å¿imilitudes, examples, contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, remote accidents, and circumÅ¿tances, and therefore they had need of Å¿ome Å¿hort remembrance, to pull their wits by the elbow, and will them not to diue too deepe, leaÅ¿t they, who by reaÅ¿on Å¿hould beÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand their reaÅ¿ons (I meane the meaner wits, who for moÅ¿t part are generall auditors) be depriued of that inÅ¿truction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21840:108"/> the Oratour intendeth, and they expected. Thirdly, we muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue, that in amplifications (which are in effect nothing elÅ¿e but either exaggerations, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations of reaÅ¿ons) diuers things are to be noted.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, the reaÅ¿ons which we amplifie, require great perÅ¿picuitie, and apertneÅ¿Å¿e in deliuerie, becauÅ¿e the attention which otherwiÅ¿e Å¿hould be imployed about the affection, will wholy be conÅ¿umed or drawne to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding: for it is impoÅ¿sible to attend much at one time both to Å¿peculation and affection. Furthermore our Å¿peech being curÅ¿orie, and Å¿pecially framed for meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, will not be able to make any impreÅ¿sion in audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, except our reaÅ¿ons be meruailous plaine &amp; euident.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, our reaÅ¿ons Å¿hould be largely declared, and yet with Å¿harpe, and Å¿hort varietie interlaced: reÅ¿embling a volley of Å¿hot Å¿peedily deliuered, but not without bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets to batter downe the walles of wilfull affections.

                        <p>VNto the former CircumÅ¿tances, we may for better diÅ¿tinction &amp; fuller comprehenÅ¿ion of the matter, adde 4. more. The firÅ¿t is, Vehemency of affection, which appertaineth to the maner of giving, &amp; may be

CircumÅ¿tance of Alacritie: yet in very deed theÅ¿e two differ: for divers times wee give things Å¿peedily, and quickly, becauÅ¿e wee eÅ¿teeme them not much, or for Å¿ome intereÅ¿t, or other reÅ¿pect; albeit with no great affection: yet the way to wade into mens heartes, and diÅ¿cover whether they beÅ¿tow their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites vpon vs, with Å¿uch intire and full affections or no, may bee theÅ¿e.

If Å¿ome danger be imminent vnto the giver for Å¿uch a gift. 5. If the giver be our intire friend. 6.

                        <p>The Å¿econd is, if the gift be common to many; as if a Prince bring a Conduit of moÅ¿t excellent water into the Centre of a Cittie. If a Noble man erect a great HoÅ¿pitall for the poore, blind, lame, and impotent. If a devout Cittizen give all he hath to builde a Church, Bridge, or Å¿uch like charitable workes, theÅ¿e benefites, as they are extended to many, Å¿o they are more worthie in this reÅ¿pect, then Å¿uch as are communicated to few.</p>
                        <p>The third is, if in giving gifts among a multitude of equall deÅ¿ert, one be Å¿ingled from the reÅ¿t, vpon whom it is beÅ¿towed, for in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e, affection Å¿igniorizeth, and love maketh election, becauÅ¿e when in the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there is none or Å¿mall difference in merite, then the determination reÅ¿teth vpon the givers good will, which then may beÅ¿t be declared, when among many, Å¿pecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one is Å¿evered.</p>

If apertly by Å¿ome circumÅ¿tance of Å¿peech or requeÅ¿t he maketh, we Å¿ee evidently Å¿ome commoditie conioyned, as for example, in all Å¿uiters preÅ¿entes, a man of a bad Å¿cent may eaÅ¿ily feele a Å¿mell of profit, which perfumeth thoÅ¿e gifts. 3. If a mean man beÅ¿tow a great gift vpon one in authoritie, which hath no neede of it, Å¿uch a token for moÅ¿t part telleth his maÅ¿ters errand, to wit, that Å¿uch a preÅ¿ent muÅ¿t prepare the way for Å¿ome future favour: and this rule we are to thinke holdeth Å¿o much the Å¿urer, when the giver is in Å¿ome want and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿itie. 4. If the cuÅ¿tomary vÅ¿e of Å¿uch giftes require Å¿ome intereÅ¿t, as commonly poore mens New-yeere giftes, require better recompenÅ¿ations then they bring.</p>

                        <p>I am not ignorant that the immenÅ¿ity of mans will may chop and change theÅ¿e motives of love in diverÅ¿e manners: for if we releeve often poore mens miÅ¿eries for vaine-glory, we pervert the vertue of mercy; if Å¿ome faÅ¿t for hypocriÅ¿ie, they abuÅ¿e the virtue of temperance; if Å¿ome pray with pride and contempt, as the arrogant PhariÅ¿ee, they Å¿tayne the vertue of religion: and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tionles, any wicked man may love him that eaÅ¿ily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth iniuries, not for honeÅ¿ty and vertue, but thereby to prevayle more againÅ¿t him, and crow more inÅ¿olent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over him, to cooÅ¿in him the more boldely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyve him without puniÅ¿hment.

                        <p>Furthermore, for better intelligence it is to be conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Divines and morall PhiloÅ¿ophers diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h two Å¿orts of Hatred, the one they call <hi>Odium abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis;</hi> Hatred of abomination: the other, <hi>Odium ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micitiae,</hi> that is, Hatred of enmitie.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21840:144"/> theefe, and loveth the gallowes, as a due puniÅ¿hment and deÅ¿erved evil for the theefe. ContrariwiÅ¿e, as in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of enmitie, the perÅ¿on Å¿tayned with vice, mooveth me to deteÅ¿t him and wiÅ¿h him evill, Å¿o in hatred of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for the love I beare any perÅ¿on, I hate all evils which may befall him: for example, a man loveth his child, and therefore abhorreth death as evil of the child; a iuÅ¿t man loveth God, and therefore deteÅ¿teth Å¿inne, as an iniurie done to God; a man loveth his owne health, and therefore hateth diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, or what elÅ¿e may croÅ¿Å¿e his health. So that here we have three things: hatred of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in reÅ¿pect of the perÅ¿on we love: love of evill, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of the perÅ¿on wee hate: hatred and love com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one reÅ¿pect of perfite enmitie and complete hatred.</p>
                        <p>BeÅ¿ides, as love levelleth at goodneÅ¿Å¿e, without deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or hoping for it, and onely taketh a good liking and complacence therein: Å¿o deÅ¿ire paÅ¿Å¿eth further, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿heth the enioying thereof, albeit Å¿uch a wiÅ¿h medleth not with hope of obtayning it; for many wiÅ¿h Mines of golde, States and Kingdomes, which they never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect, nor hope to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e: Hope addeth expectation, for perceyving Å¿ome probable poÅ¿Å¿ibility of purchace, Å¿he Å¿tandeth wayting how to come by it. For example, Cardinall <hi>WolÅ¿ey</hi> in his yonger yeeres perhaps loved, and deÅ¿ired the degree of a Cardinall, but yet being Å¿o farre from it, he had Å¿mall reaÅ¿on to expect it, but after he was entertained of the King, and imployed in affaires for the State, then he got ground for expectation, and Å¿o fell into the paÅ¿Å¿ion of Hope. On the other Å¿ide, hatred firÅ¿t deteÅ¿teth the evill in it Å¿elfe, either of enmitie or abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as wicked men, death, diÅ¿honor, &amp;c. without

DeteÅ¿tation <hi>fuga</hi> or flight abhorreth them as hurtfull to vs or our friends: but as yet they beeing afarre off, and not very likely to befall, entereth not into the paÅ¿Å¿ion of Feare, the which then Å¿tirreth, when danger approcheth. Ire proceedeth from Å¿ome iniurie offered, and therefore hateth the inflictor, and by all meanes poÅ¿Å¿ible Å¿eeketh revenge. Wherefore Ire, Feare, Flight, including every one of them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Å¿ort or Å¿pice of Hatred, what generally can be Å¿aid of it, will Å¿erve for all them in particular; howbeit, Å¿ome Å¿peciall conÅ¿iderations we will Å¿et downe in Å¿peciall for their peculiar Motion.</p>

                           <p>WE Å¿aid, that flight or deteÅ¿tation was oppoÅ¿ite to deÅ¿ier: and that deÅ¿ier was the wiÅ¿hing of a thing abÅ¿tracted from hope or expectation thereof, as every beggar would be a King if he might chooÅ¿e, albeit he never had, nor is like to have any hope of the aÅ¿piring thereunto. Flight is a deteÅ¿tation of Å¿ome evill, though not imminent, nor exÅ¿pected, yet Å¿uch an evill as we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it and deteÅ¿t it, and poÅ¿Å¿ibly may befall vs, as a king to fall to poverty, beggery, or Å¿ervitude he abhorreth; yet becauÅ¿e he living in Å¿uch proÅ¿perity conceiveth no danger nor perill, therefore he Å¿tandeth in no feare.

Ordinarily the goods of the Å¿oule are prized above the goods of the body, and theÅ¿e more eÅ¿teemed then the favours of fortune, and they preferred before the blazon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: becauÅ¿e, as the origen of love, is firÅ¿t a mans Å¿elfe, and for it all other things beloved; Å¿o theÅ¿e goods, which are moÅ¿t neere himÅ¿elfe, and concerne his Å¿ubÅ¿tance, or neceÅ¿Å¿ary preÅ¿ervation thereof, are more affectually lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then they which touch him leÅ¿Å¿e; as firÅ¿t his body, then goods of fortune, and laÅ¿t of all, Å¿ame. I Å¿ayd ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, for if we compare a title of honor, as to be Earle, Baron, &amp;c. theÅ¿e are to bee preferred before a great Å¿umme of money: yet I doubt not, but if election were given an Earle to bee a beggar, and an Earle all his life; or a Å¿imple Merchant, but exceeding rich: hee would rather chooÅ¿e this, and refuÅ¿e that, for there is no miÅ¿erie like Nobility preÅ¿Å¿ed with penury. Wherefore alwayes muÅ¿t be held with the chiefeÅ¿t of one degree of goods, with the chiefeÅ¿t of an other, and Å¿o the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿on framed, as the chiefeÅ¿t goods of the Å¿oule, of grace, vertue, wiÅ¿edome, prudence, &amp;c. are to be valued above the life of the body, integritie of members, wealth, fame, &amp;c. I know againÅ¿t this diviÅ¿ion and reaÅ¿on, Å¿ome will obiect that common Text of Scripture; <hi>Melius</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Proverb. 22. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>est nomen bonum, quam divitiae multae: Å¿uper argentum &amp; aurum gratia bona.</hi> A good Name is better then many riches; and a good grace, that is a gratious and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good liking among men; above Å¿ilver and gold. But to this Text I anÅ¿were, that in it are involved good friends, and their gratious good willes, which are favors of Fortune, and Å¿o to be preÅ¿erred before riches, which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21840:154"/> are contayned in the Å¿ame degree. Secondly, fame and a good name Å¿ometime is neceÅ¿Å¿arie to the perfection of vertue, and the good of the Å¿oule, as without them, the Preacher Å¿hould perÅ¿wade but Å¿orrily; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate be obeyed but Å¿ervilely, the Prince honored but ceremoniouÅ¿ly; &amp; in fine, take away a good Name, and all vertuous examples wil Å¿eeme counterfeit hypocriÅ¿ie. Thirdly, true it is, a good Name ought to bee prized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many riches, but I thinke there be few rich men in the world, that had not rather bee iniuried in their good Name, then fall to begging. Fourthly, a good Name or a good Fame wayteth vpon a good Life, and he that liveth badly, for moÅ¿t part carrieth as bad a name and a fame: to our purpoÅ¿e then, a man muÅ¿t have care of his good Name, becauÅ¿e hee Å¿hould live vertuouÅ¿ly, whereby Å¿uch a good Name is gotten: and indeed, Å¿uch a precious fruite hanging vpon Å¿o noble a Plant, Å¿urpaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth all worldly wealth; and this I take to be the true and literall Å¿enÅ¿e of this Text of Scripture, whence-from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haleth that Å¿weete and fragrant Å¿mell of gracious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing, and contenting of all men: for a Å¿oule that is really vertuous, and Å¿o knowen and blazed abroad, cannot but Å¿tirre vp mens hearts to like and love well Å¿uch a PerÅ¿on.</p>
                           <p>Every iniury then offered, tendeth to the bereaving of vs, of Å¿ome of theÅ¿e goods related, of Å¿oule, body, fortune or fame, and therefore according to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of goodneÅ¿Å¿e, ought to be eÅ¿teemed.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if the iniury did vs much harme, and the iniurer no good: if it hurt many a Towne, Citie, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, State or Kingdome: for, to more perÅ¿ons it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, the poyÅ¿on is more peÅ¿tilent, and the malice more vehement.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, At what end the Iniurie aymed, if he coÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to procure meanes to murder, to commit adultery, to hurt the State: this externall Motive augmenteth his malice.</p>

                           <p>AS there is nothing in this life more potent then pleaÅ¿ure to move men to action, and the attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of great exploits, Å¿o there is nothing more requiÅ¿ite to be knowne to any man that will be gratefull &amp; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto men, then how to move and excite them to pleaÅ¿ure. True it is that ambitious men aÅ¿pire after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: but why thirÅ¿t they Å¿o after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, but becauÅ¿e they take an extraordinary delight to be honored? why do covetous cormogions diÅ¿till the beÅ¿t Å¿ubÅ¿tance of their braines to get riches, but after they have gotten them, to delight in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion or fruition of them? the Å¿ame may be Å¿aid of all inordinate paÅ¿Å¿ions which conÅ¿iÅ¿t in the proÅ¿equution of Å¿ome amiable or deÅ¿iderable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. And the reaÅ¿on is, for ioy &amp; delight are a poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ome good thing, wherin nature receiveth great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, and therefore a man in ioy participateth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of felicitie, for felicitie is nothing elÅ¿e but a complete contentation, quietnes and reÅ¿t of the minde and body; wherefore the greater delight either really or apparently apporteth the greater contentation, reÅ¿t and quietneÅ¿Å¿e, &amp; conÅ¿equently the greater felicitie. And as there is no man affecteth not extremely felicitie &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o there is no man extremely deÅ¿ireth not ioy &amp; delight. They therefore that can move theÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ions, feed them &amp; continue them, muÅ¿t needs be moÅ¿t grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, acceptable, and beloved; yea they may almoÅ¿t do what they liÅ¿t in any company, for all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> love happines
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:21840:158"/> and the continuance thereof: and thoÅ¿e that can aptly Å¿tir vp this paÅ¿Å¿ion may be accounted authors of a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿triall happineÅ¿Å¿e and felicitie. Therefore I will alittle enlarge this diÅ¿courÅ¿e as moÅ¿t profitable, if not neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary for moÅ¿t Å¿orts of men.</p>
                           <p>FirÅ¿t of all we muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e, that all thoÅ¿e motives<note place="margin">Motives to delight.</note> which Å¿tir vp love and affection, conÅ¿equently move de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ier and delight: for love is like the quality of lenity or lightnes in fier, which inclineth and bendeth it to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deÅ¿ier is the motion, paÅ¿Å¿age, or voyage; delight the quietnes or reÅ¿t of the Å¿oule in her obiect, and therefore all thoÅ¿e cauÅ¿es of love we have delivered in the matter of Love, all thoÅ¿e may Å¿erve for this Å¿ubiect.</p>
                           <p>Secondly it is requiÅ¿ite a man conÅ¿ider the inclinations of thoÅ¿e perÅ¿ons he would move to delight, for <hi>quicquid recipitur per modum recipient is recipitur,</hi> according to the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the hearer are received the words of the Å¿peaker.

It is a world to Å¿ee how blind Å¿elfe-love maketh women to dote of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and it Å¿eemeth ridiculous Å¿ometime, to Å¿ee how they are fed and delighted with the panigeries of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ites. I have Å¿eene Å¿ome old Ladies halfe rotten, &amp; Å¿ome others monÅ¿trouÅ¿ly deformed, to take an extraordinarie delight in themÅ¿elves, when others for flattery commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their beauty. In this point alÅ¿o we may conÅ¿ider a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motive, to delight in that thing a man is delighted in, as if one be delighted in MuÅ¿ick, in hunting, hauking, &amp;c. Å¿ome prety new deviÅ¿e in any of them would pleaÅ¿e

This act of new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing inventions proportionate to their paÅ¿Å¿ions &amp; incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations whom we would move to delight, cannot but greatly help vs in the way of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, if it be plauÅ¿ibly and artificially handled: for otherwiÅ¿e if it be groÅ¿Å¿ely managed, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

He therefore that will move delight in this matter of hope, muÅ¿t exactly declare the certain grounds &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21840:159"/> Å¿ecuritie of obteyning the thing exÅ¿pected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of exciting hope, alleaged in the precedent Paragraffe.</p>
                           <p>4. BecauÅ¿e delight conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ome good thing reall or apparant; therefore all thoÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons which tend to the amplification or evident demonÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goodnes of the thing, all thoÅ¿e are fewell of delight, and Å¿parks of ioy. For example, a man hath bought a Mannour-houÅ¿e wherein he delighteth: to pleaÅ¿e and delight him there is nothing more fit, then to amplifie the goodnes thereof: as for Å¿ituation, it Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in a pleaÅ¿ant ayre, free from fennes or Å¿tanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no infection neere it, the inhabitants in former times were of a very good complexion, lived many yeares, were Å¿trong, wittie, &amp;c. all which are good Å¿ignes of a healthfull Å¿oyle: the roomes and conveyances are very apt &amp; proportioned, the walls and roofes firme &amp; durable, the water Å¿weet, the walks, garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s, &amp; other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities Å¿o pleaÅ¿ant, as they reÅ¿emble a Paradice.</p>
                           <p>5. It is admirable how the minching &amp; particulariÅ¿ing of the obiect of delight increaÅ¿eth and augmenteth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, wherefore the fantaÅ¿ticall and laÅ¿civious Poets, though vainely and vitiouÅ¿ly, yet wittily and artificially depaint their lovers bodies from the head to the heeles, in every part diÅ¿covering one or other perfection, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or amiableneÅ¿Å¿e, apt to move and Å¿tir vp delight. And herein alÅ¿o all TradeÅ¿-men excell, for to perÅ¿wade their wares to be good and perfit, they will preÅ¿ently open vnto you a number of circumÅ¿tances or oppurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of goodnes or excellencie wherewith their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiÅ¿e is affected: for as they have more inÅ¿ight, and know more exactly the goodnes and defects of their wares then other men, Å¿o they can vnfold beÅ¿t the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21840:159"/> reaÅ¿ons which move love &amp; delight. And for this cauÅ¿e I would have all thoÅ¿e who would move men to good life &amp; vertue, to induce them thereunto, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariÅ¿ing of the pleaÅ¿ures &amp; delights incident thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as the quietnes of conÅ¿cience, the gratefulnes to God, the honour &amp; reputation of all good men, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the world to come, and every one of theÅ¿e the finer it is Å¿ifted, the more pleaÅ¿ant it will appeare.</p>
                           <p>6. It importeth much in moving delight to perÅ¿wade the Å¿tabilitie and continuance thereof, that it Å¿eeme not like a May-flower, which is budded, bloÅ¿Å¿omed, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted in a Å¿mall time: and the reaÅ¿on is, for momentarie and curÅ¿orie delights are for their brevitie rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿eable then commendable. The continuance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may be grounded vpon the removing of all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments which any way may impeach or diminiÅ¿h it.</p>
                           <p>7. As there are two Å¿orts of delight, Å¿enÅ¿uall &amp; intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall; Å¿enÅ¿uall which taketh his Å¿ource from Å¿enÅ¿e &amp; paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions; and intellectuall, which draweth his origen from the vnderÅ¿tanding and the will: Å¿o in every obiect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light there is a certaine intenÅ¿ive goodnes &amp; perfection, and there is an extenÅ¿ive: as for example in a Cellar of wine there may be excellent good wine, and varietie of excellent good wine, and thereby our taÅ¿te may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the perfection of wine, and with the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of wine. In like manner in all the obiects of delight, we may find a certaine intenÅ¿ion of goodnes, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine extenÅ¿ion, and both theÅ¿e well vnderÅ¿tood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, exceedingly increaÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ure &amp; delight: for the intention filleth and Å¿atiateth the Å¿oule, and the extenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or varietie taketh away a certaine diÅ¿taÅ¿tfull loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omneÅ¿Å¿e which one kind of vniforme pleaÅ¿ure draweth with it.</p>

Yea, I will adde an other conÅ¿ideration, of no Å¿maller importance then the reÅ¿t, that although as wee Å¿ee by dayly experience, many men Å¿tudy night and day, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth their braines and eies vpon their bookes, yet I am of opinion, that if we could Å¿ee the opinions, even of the beÅ¿t learned man in the world, with as plaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿picuitie, as we diÅ¿cerne blacke from white, wee Å¿hould find in his vnderÅ¿tanding more errours then truethes, more falÅ¿ities then verities, more ignorances then Å¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, more that ought to be forgotten, then is well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; finally more chaffe then corne, (I alwayes except matters of faith and religion.) The reaÅ¿ons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to this opinion, are theÅ¿e. FirÅ¿t, I Å¿ee Å¿uch varieties of opinions even among the profoundeÅ¿t wittes, that ever the worlde yeelded, (whoÅ¿e
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:21840:169"/> writings are extant) about the Å¿elfe Å¿amething, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and condemning another, both bringing Å¿trong reaÅ¿ons to confirme their opinions; one or both muÅ¿t needes erre, the Trueth being one and indiviÅ¿ible. Secondly, I perceyve the Å¿ame profound Scholers, at one time defending with many reaÅ¿ons one opinion, and after, with as great boldneÅ¿Å¿e impugning the Å¿ame, retracting the former. And why, I pray you, may they not erre the Å¿econd time, as well as the firÅ¿t? for I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, they thought they had as great evidence &amp; aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urance before, as they preÅ¿ently poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e.

                        <p>26 Above all other evils incident to an evill life, of great force to reÅ¿traine our vntoward willes from vice, is the extreame iniurie we offer to God by Å¿inne, tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ing his lawe, perverting his order, diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, and providence, iniuring his infinite goodnes, which ought of all creatures to be beloved, deÅ¿piÅ¿ing his MaieÅ¿tie, to which, as to their laÅ¿t end, all men ought to direct their actions.

                  <p>TheÅ¿e obÅ¿eruations then of PhiÅ¿itians preÅ¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed as true, for men that are wiÅ¿e, vertuous, and experimented in their faculties ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued (for wiÅ¿dome and experience protect them from errour, and honeÅ¿tie from lying and deceite) it were good to examine and Å¿earch out the cauÅ¿e of theÅ¿e notable alterations and daungers of death in the <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres, for thoÅ¿e humors which alter the bodie, and diÅ¿poÅ¿e it to Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, and death; the Å¿ame bend the Å¿oule to take inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections and paÅ¿Å¿ions. I haue heard Å¿ome PhiÅ¿itians reÅ¿olue this doubt into the influence of heauens, to wit, that Å¿o manie courÅ¿es of the Sunne, Moone, and Planets from the time of a mans Natiuitie, worke Å¿uch effects; Å¿o that Å¿ome men, let them liue neuer Å¿o orderly, after Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie circular motions of the Sunne and Moone haue warbled ouer their heads, vppon neceÅ¿Å¿itie they muÅ¿t fall into one Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e or another, and Å¿o die.</p>

Loe thou haÅ¿t put my dayes menÅ¿urable; that is, preÅ¿cribed certaine bounds and limmits of age not paÅ¿Å¿able: and therefore both PhiloÅ¿ophers and PhiÅ¿itians conclude, that a man with manie diÅ¿orders, Å¿urfeits, exerciÅ¿es, &amp;c. may Å¿horten the natural courÅ¿e of his life, but that he cannot any way prolong it, &amp; paÅ¿Å¿e the prefixed inÅ¿tant of his death: the Å¿imilitude we haue in a candle lighted, for let a man vÅ¿e all the diligence poÅ¿Å¿ible, the light and fire feeding vpon the candle, perforce will conÅ¿ume it at laÅ¿t; and God or any Angell behoulding the quantitie of the wike, tallow, time of the yeere (for in cold weather a candle conÅ¿umeth more then in hote, <hi>Per antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristaÅ¿in</hi>) and other circumÅ¿tances may preciÅ¿ely foretell, that Å¿uch a candle cannot continue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning longer then Å¿uch a minute of Å¿uch an houre; in a Å¿horter time it may be conÅ¿umed with wind, witches, Å¿nuffe-fallings, or Å¿uch like things which waÅ¿te it away, but longer it cannot be prolonged: after the Å¿ame Å¿ort Å¿tandeth the courÅ¿es and the liÅ¿tes of our liues preÅ¿cribed by God and prefixed by nature: and Å¿o God hath appointed theÅ¿e Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, and Nonarie yeeres as beÅ¿t Å¿eeming his wiÅ¿dome and prouidence.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e manners of declaration I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, for albeit I doe thinke them both in Å¿ome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21840:195"/> things moÅ¿t true, yet they are too generall and remote to anÅ¿were and Å¿atisfie fully our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21840:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> of meate, and are not able to diÅ¿gueÅ¿t them; as for example, Å¿aith he, Å¿ome cannot abide beefe, others Å¿hell fiÅ¿hes; and we haue manie who cannot Å¿o much as endure the Å¿ight of cheeÅ¿e, others of aples: And yet theÅ¿e Å¿ame perÅ¿ons by little and little are brought to eate, diÅ¿gueÅ¿t, yea and greatly to like them? He anÅ¿wereth, that all beaÅ¿ts and men haue naturall propenÅ¿ions, to Å¿uch meates as are conÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the naturall proprieties of theyr bodies, and abhor Å¿uch things as are contrarie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lyon feedeth vppon fleÅ¿h, not vpon hay; and the Oxe vpon hay not vpon fleÅ¿h; yet it falleth out that by tract of time, thoÅ¿e meates which we deteÅ¿ted, after by vÅ¿e become familiar, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the body, and by the Å¿ucke of theyr nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, change the affections and qualities of the Å¿tomack, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as that meate, which before was moleÅ¿tfull, and in very deede hurtfull, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Å¿auorie and healthfull: and this he proueth, not onely to be true in men and beaÅ¿ts, but alÅ¿o in feedes and trees, whoÅ¿e fruite in Å¿ome countries are poyÅ¿on, transferred into other Å¿oyles where they receiue another kind of noriÅ¿hment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not only by tract of time; not hurtfull, but very healthfull; not poyÅ¿onfull, but pleaÅ¿ant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is to be conÅ¿idered, that our bodies generally haue certaine courÅ¿es, paÅ¿Å¿ages, Å¿tations or periods, wherein they notably change their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations: till 21. yeeres, or 25. at the moÅ¿t, we grow in height, for Å¿ome come to theyr
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21840:196"/> full growth Å¿ooner, Å¿ome later: from 25. to fortie two, or forty fiue, we grow in breadth or thicknes, from this, till the end of our dayes we decline: the cauÅ¿e of theÅ¿e three notorious alterations is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate or <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> (which in mine opinion is nothing els but the vitall temper, and qualification of euery Å¿olid part of our bodies) the which reÅ¿iding in a moiÅ¿t body, cauÅ¿eth it to grow, like the heate in a loafe of Dowe Å¿et in the Ouen: afterwards, what with internall heate, externall drying of the windes, and Å¿unne, and other conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exerciÅ¿es, which daily exÅ¿iccate the body, &amp; draw out the vndegueÅ¿ted moyÅ¿ture, the innated heate is not able to rouze vp the body any more in height, but Å¿preadeth it abroade, and Å¿o enlargeth, and ingroÅ¿Å¿eth it: after which continuall working, heate is weakened, and Å¿o by little and little Å¿till de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth: and finally reÅ¿olueth in diÅ¿Å¿olution.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in this Å¿eptuarie number of our yeeres, although we cannot diÅ¿couer Å¿uch notorious dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as in the three former paÅ¿Å¿ages, yet in theÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e, we may obÅ¿erue Å¿ome markable change. At the firÅ¿t Å¿eauenth yeere, men commonly note, that then the child beginneth, to haue Å¿ome little Å¿parkes of reaÅ¿on: and for this cauÅ¿e, the Cannon Law permitteth Å¿uch, directed by their parents or Tutors, <hi>contrahere Å¿ponÅ¿alia,</hi> to make a promiÅ¿e of future mariage. In the foureteene yeere, the youth is thought to haue the perfit vÅ¿e of reaÅ¿on, &amp; then the Cannons account him capable of marriage.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21840:196"/> At twenty one, a man is reputed able iudiciouÅ¿ly to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of his goods, and faculties, and therfore the Common-law riddeth him then of his vvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip, and the Cannons giue him leaue to take the order of Å¿ubdeacon: the firÅ¿t Å¿eauen yeeres are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>infantia,</hi> the Å¿econd <hi>pueritia,</hi> the third <hi>adoleÅ¿cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the fourth, that is, from twenty one to twenty eight, <hi>iuuentus,</hi> from thence to forty nine, hee is eÅ¿teemed to Å¿tand <hi>in Å¿tatu virili,</hi> the next till Å¿ixtie three is <hi>Å¿enectus,</hi> after, till Å¿eauenty &amp; Å¿eauentie Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for moÅ¿t part enÅ¿ueth <hi>decrepita aetas.</hi> In all theÅ¿e periods, or <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres, it is to be noted, that although the change in that yeere be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued moÅ¿t palpably, and Å¿enÅ¿ibly, yet in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, they were preparing, working, and Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diÅ¿poÅ¿ing there-vnto: as for example, wee muÅ¿t not thinke that the leaÅ¿t drop of rayne, which in effect breaketh the Å¿tone, dooth it of it Å¿elfe, for that were impoÅ¿Å¿ible, but it doth it in vertue, and by force and working of all the former: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for this cauÅ¿e they were called <hi>anni Å¿calares,</hi> for that euery yeere precedent, was a Å¿teppe to the laÅ¿t, wherein the Ladder or Å¿taires were ended.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a great diÅ¿pute among PhiÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, what Å¿hould be the cauÅ¿e of the ParoxiÅ¿mes, or fittes in Agues, and once I my Å¿elfe being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a tertian Ague, in <hi>Italie,</hi> in the Cittie of <hi>Como,</hi> there came two PhiÅ¿itians my deere friends, and a Doctor of Diuinitie all at one time to viÅ¿ite me, and euen then I Å¿tood in expectation of my
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21840:197"/> fit. After many complements &amp; diÅ¿courÅ¿es about my Å¿icknes, at laÅ¿t I demaunded theÅ¿e two Doctors of PhiÅ¿icke, that they would reÅ¿olue mee in one doubt about my diÅ¿eaÅ¿e: they aunÅ¿wered, with a good will: Well, Å¿ayd I, you both conclude, and it Å¿tands with good reaÅ¿on, that this Å¿icknes of mine proceedeth from exceÅ¿Å¿e of choller: now I would know of you, when my fit is paÅ¿t, is the choller all diÅ¿gueÅ¿ted, conÅ¿umed, and voyded away or no? If it be conÅ¿umed, why dooth my Ague returne? if it be not conÅ¿umed, why dooth mine Ague de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? The PhiÅ¿itians here aunÅ¿wered one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ie to another: for the firÅ¿t Å¿ayd it was diÅ¿gueÅ¿ted: Why then returneth mine Ague? For this cauÅ¿e quoth he, the Ague proceedeth not onely of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but of choller putrified, corrupted, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oned. Now Å¿ir, the choller poyÅ¿oned is conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but other choller which remaineth, is not corrupted, but by the next paroxiÅ¿me it will be corrupted: Well, Å¿ayd I, what thing is that which corrupteth &amp; poiÅ¿oneth that good choller, which before was not corrupted? It Å¿eemeth Å¿trange to me, how Å¿o much preciÅ¿ely Å¿hould be corrupted, and the other beeing Å¿o neere lying by it, or rather vnited with it, yea mingled in it, not to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In truth I remember not what he aunÅ¿wered, but I am Å¿ure he Å¿atisfied none of vs all. The other Doctor of PhiÅ¿icke Å¿ayd, it was not conÅ¿umed, but nature feeling the force of that poyÅ¿on, vnited her Å¿elfe to fight againÅ¿t it, and Å¿o allayed moÅ¿t of the vehemencie, vigour, and malignitie thereof: and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21840:197"/> hee gaue an example of a pot of water Å¿et on the fire, for quoth hee, if the coales be couered with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes, the hote water cooleth, blow the fire and it warmeth and boyleth, let aÅ¿hes returne, or the fire die, the water returneth to the firÅ¿t coldneÅ¿Å¿e: So quoth hee, the poyÅ¿on of the choller, by natures might is ouercome, when the Ague departeth, but after that thoÅ¿e Å¿pirits and forces, which nature had vnited, are diÅ¿perÅ¿ed, the fire is quenched, and choller againe corrupted. But quoth the other PhiÅ¿itian, Å¿o the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hould neuer depart, for if your choller be Å¿till in cooling and heating, and nature now fighting, now ceaÅ¿ing, when I pray you Å¿hall this combat be finally ended? Marry Å¿ir quoth his fellow Doctor, in this Å¿ort, nature mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the forces of choller this fit, and allayeth them: now nature in the meane time, is Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with good foode, and the humour either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or quailed with phiÅ¿icke, and Å¿o by little and little it is quite diÅ¿gueÅ¿ted.</p>
                  <p>Not Å¿o Å¿aid the other, for then the Å¿econd fit Å¿hould alwayes be leÅ¿Å¿e then the firÅ¿t, and the third leÅ¿Å¿e then the Å¿econd, and Å¿o forward to the laÅ¿t: but this is falÅ¿e, for his third and fourth fits, were much more vehement, then either the firÅ¿t or Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And beÅ¿ides, by this declaration, no man Å¿hould euer die vpon an Ague. For if in euery fit, the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e ceaÅ¿Å¿ed not, vntill the humour were allayed, then certainly in Agues, (which are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21840:198"/> the fitte Å¿houlde neuer paÅ¿Å¿e, which is moÅ¿t falÅ¿e.</p>
                  <p>With this the Doctor of Diuinitie, who was a very good PhiloÅ¿opher, and for that he had beene much troubled with maladies, he was like manie wrangling Gentlemen, a petty-fogging PhiÅ¿itian at his owne coÅ¿ts, as they be petty-fogging Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers thorow theyr owne Å¿utes. Why Å¿aid the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, may we not hold that the Ague is in the liuer and hart? No quoth the PhiÅ¿itians both, that can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be, becauÅ¿e no PhiÅ¿itian euer held, that any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue was <hi>in partibus Å¿olidis,</hi> that is, in the hart &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp;c. except the <hi>Hecticke.</hi> Well Å¿aid the diuine, I Å¿ay not that it is in the hart and liuer immediatly, for that I will confeÅ¿Å¿e perforce muÅ¿t be choller, but I Å¿ay the fountaine and Å¿pring, the roote and crigen to reÅ¿ide in the liuer, the which immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauÅ¿eth corrupted blood and inflamed choller, for they beeing extraordinarily corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues with vehement heate, cannot but engender blood, Å¿pirits, and humors of like infection and corruption. And by this way I aunÅ¿were the firÅ¿t doubt that when the Ague ceaÅ¿eth, choller is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueÅ¿ted: Why then returneth it againe? Marie Å¿ir, becauÅ¿e the hart and liuer beeing out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in that Å¿pace of time engender Å¿o many more peruerÅ¿e humors, as oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>Å¿Å¿e nature, Å¿o vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dangerouÅ¿ly, that Å¿hee muÅ¿t imploy all her might to reÅ¿iÅ¿t them, abate them, extinguiÅ¿h them. In truth MaiÅ¿ter Doctor (Å¿aid I) this opinion I like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21840:198"/> very well, and I will confirme it, for Å¿ince mine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue firÅ¿t beganne, theÅ¿e PhiÅ¿itians haue inculcated nothing Å¿o much vnto me, by word and deede, as to coole my liuer: to this effect all their Å¿yrrops and waters of Endiue, Sicory, and Barley tended. And with this diÅ¿courÅ¿e wee ended our diÅ¿pute, &amp; mine Ague: the which with this pleaÅ¿ant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference paÅ¿Å¿ed away.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Plato</hi> auoucheth, that Agues haue ages<note place="margin">Plato in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. de Natur.</note> like men, as alÅ¿o conÅ¿ummations and ends, vvith whom <hi>Galen</hi> conÅ¿enteth: This Å¿entence of <hi>Plato, ValeÅ¿ius</hi> a worthy PhiÅ¿itian explicateth in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. As there are two Å¿orts of diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, Å¿harpe and<note place="margin">ValeÅ¿ius de Sacra Philo. cap. 7.</note> cronicall, both which haue theyr decretory daies, but not alike, for the Å¿harpe haue odde dayes, eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Å¿eauen: the cronicall twenty, Å¿ixty, eightie, a hundred: Å¿o there are two prerogations or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of life. the one is common to many, the other to fewe, and Å¿uch as are of a moÅ¿t liuely conÅ¿tituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: both of them haue theyr <hi>Clymactericall</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory yeeres. The firÅ¿t wee number by Å¿eauen and nine, the latter wee count by tenne, and the laÅ¿t period is a hundred and twenty.</p>
                  <p>To this DiÅ¿courÅ¿e of <hi>ValeÅ¿ius</hi> lette vs adde a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne poynt of experience and doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galen. lib. r. de diebus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretorijs c. 22.</note> who in the decretorie dayes of a feuer, which numbreth by Å¿eauen Å¿pecially, he will tell you the fourth day, whether the Agew will leaue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient the Å¿eauenth, or whether hee Å¿hall die vpon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21840:199"/> the Å¿eauenth day, or no: and alÅ¿o withall, hee teacheth to foretell the very houre of death vppon the Å¿eauenth day.</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿t of all, out of theÅ¿e conÅ¿iderations we may gather as much as will Å¿ufficiently (I hope) Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the QueÅ¿tion propoÅ¿ed in the beginning of this Section, <hi>viz:</hi> why in theÅ¿e <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeeres men commonly die? To which I doe aunÅ¿were, That for euery Å¿ixe yeeres or eight, men Å¿till ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppe more or leÅ¿Å¿e humours, which prepare the way for an Agew in the Å¿eauen or nine: As wee Å¿ayde before, when the fitte is paÅ¿t, the heart and liuer prepare humours for the next enÅ¿uing, and in caÅ¿e they be not Å¿ufficient in the Å¿eauen, they multiply to the nine: if in this they faile, then they paÅ¿Å¿e to the foureteene, then to eighteene, &amp;c. And for this cauÅ¿e PhyÅ¿itians councell theyr Patients to purge in the Spring and Authumne, to hinder the increaÅ¿e of humours, albeit they feele themÅ¿elues nothing diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed at all.</p>
                  <p>This we may declare by the example of them, who are infected with hereditary diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, as the gowte, or the Å¿tone: for albeit they euidently appeere not till olde age, yet in all the progreÅ¿Å¿e of their yeeres, the partes and humours infenÅ¿ibly are prepared. Or wee may Å¿ay, that in Å¿ixe or eight yeeres the liuer and heart which are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of bloud, and origens of humours are Å¿o in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and corrupted, that in the laÅ¿t yeere they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21840:199"/> engender more vnnaturall Å¿uperfluous humours, than can Å¿tand with the right and naturall conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body.</p>
                  <p>But Å¿ome will Å¿ay, by this opinion a man Å¿hould euer be Å¿icke, for hee Å¿houlde neuer want corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted humours, wherein Å¿ickeneÅ¿Å¿e conÅ¿iÅ¿teth. To this I anÅ¿were; firÅ¿t, that health conÅ¿iÅ¿teth not <hi>in indiuiÅ¿ibili,</hi> in an indiuiÅ¿ible poynt, Å¿o that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not Å¿ome few peccant humours withall, but hath a certaine amplitude, like as if into a But of Å¿trong Canary Wine, a man euery moneth Å¿houlde put in halfe a pinte of water, euery day a Å¿poonefull, at the moneths end, yea the yeeres end, the Wine woulde be almoÅ¿t as potent, as at the firÅ¿t, yea and perhaps more, if it bee well hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee Å¿ee that CuÅ¿tome breedeth qualities and alterations Å¿o inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly, as in long time (till they come to a full growth) they can hardly be perceiued.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I doubt not but hee that hath for example the firÅ¿t foureteene yeere of his life for his <hi>Clymactericall,</hi> in the precedent yeeres, Å¿hall gather more corrupted humoures, then hee whoÅ¿e <hi>Clymactericall</hi> yeere is nine and fortie, and alÅ¿o feele himÅ¿elfe proportionally more weake, albeit hee can not well perceiue; for I my Å¿elfe haue knowne a man, almoÅ¿t with halfe his lungs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21840:200"/> rotten with a conÅ¿umption, and yet boldelie auowch that he was Å¿trong, for <hi>Ab aÅ¿suetis non fit paÅ¿sio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some will obiect, that wee Å¿ee by experience many menne die within the Å¿pace of a day or two, who before were as Å¿ound and whole, as coulde be: neyther in their vrine, blood, or pulÅ¿e appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any Å¿igne of Å¿ickeneÅ¿Å¿e, or Å¿uperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>To this I aunÅ¿were, that Å¿uch a man was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppreÅ¿Å¿ed with Å¿ome vehement PaÅ¿Å¿ion, or Å¿ome violent exerciÅ¿e, or Å¿ome other extrinÅ¿ecall cauÅ¿e, which accelerated, peruerted, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily augmented the humour, and Å¿o cauÅ¿ed death: for as I Å¿aide aboue, although a man (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idering the common courÅ¿e of his dayes) can not paÅ¿Å¿e his prefixed time and <hi>Clymactericall</hi> periode, yet by many meanes he may Å¿horten it.</p>
                  <p>Much more I coulde Å¿ay, <hi>prÃ²</hi> and <hi>contrÃ ,</hi> for this Declaration, but becauÅ¿e it were Å¿omething too PhyÅ¿icall, and not Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿arie for this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall TreatiÅ¿e, therefore I will bury it with Å¿ilence: for this poynt, in very trueth, is Å¿o intricate, that I perceiue, the beÅ¿t wittes are exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to extricate themÅ¿elues out of it.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21840:200"/>
                  <p>And therefore, as this I eÅ¿teeme probable, Å¿o I woulde giue any PhyÅ¿itian moÅ¿t hearty thankes, who in few woordes woulde teach mee a better way.</p>
                  <p>I Å¿ayde in briefe, for I haue Å¿eene Å¿ome Å¿uch long tedious DiÅ¿courÅ¿es, as I loathed to peruÅ¿e them, doubting leÅ¿t the vncertaine profit, would not repay the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine payne.</p>
